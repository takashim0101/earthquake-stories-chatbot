        "text": "This is what I posted on Facebook about 10 days after the Feb 22nd EQ.\nWent to Bexley/Brighton on Sunday (Fed Farmers and Students organising people) to help dig silt off people’s gardens, driveaways, the street etc. Unbelievable. Up to a metre thick at times, smelly, wet….some streets just completely destroyed – red stickered houses, power poles down, piles of mud. Lots of people have, understandably, just gone elsewhere.\nBut lots of amazing things happening too. A young woman from Tauranga had quit her job and come down to CHCH after the earthquake and had set up a kitchen in someone’s garage. This house happened to have an artesian water supply. She said food just kept turning up (the Otago Students Association were dropping off food when we got there) and she was feeding about 50 of the neighbours each night (lots of elderly people). Another elderly man was busy mowing people’s lawns, because that’s what he could manage, while we dug out his driveway. And a housing company was driving around with a water tank on the back of their truck making sure everyone had enough water.\nSo simultaneously sad and hopeful.",

        "text": "I was at the Public Hospital with my mother and youngest son. My mother was sitting in a wheelchair and Isaac and I dropped to the floor beside her, all holding on for our lives.  The lights went out and the evacuation siren started.  I finally headed home at 4.00 in the afternoon and it took two hours to get home when it normally takes 10 minutes.  On the way home I heard on the radio about the collapse of the PGC Building where a good friend worked and I was so worried about him. \nLater that night, a friend in Australia said she had seen him on the Sky News helping others out of the building so we knew he was alright, which made it so much more sad when we heard another friend was missing in the CTV Building. Christchurch is my city and I love it here but because there is no  way to blame anyone or anything, there is also no way to forgive for the loss of our friends, our homes, and our peace of mind.",

        "text": "February 25th we escaped from Christchurch the day before but we had no idea if our house was going to be red stickered. We had to work our expo in Sydney and were sleep deprived and shell shocked I guess is the best way to describe it. We contacted our landlord and asked her to get the broken windows fixed and the house secured, we wanted her to ensure the house was safe to live in since the upper floor roof looked dodgy and was sagging in places. She promised to get back to us as soon as she knew any more information.  \nOur holiday plans had to be adjusted on the fly we needed a 3 bedroom apartment not a double room, we needed to change the size of rental car from a zippy 4 seater to a people mover with at least 6 seats, we needed to adjust our travel insurance to cover a family not 2 people. The original plan had been to drive from Sydney to Adelaide and stay in cosy bed and breakfast accommodation at 3 different cities over 5 days- everything place had to be called and rearranged either cancelled completely or adjusted accordingly. Finding a new rental car was a problem on short notice, but we managed it and some of the accommodation worked out easy to change over, but all of the things took the best part of the day to re organise. It was a tiring day having to readjust everything and to set up a stand and work at the same time.",

        "text": "And so, it begins again..   Dec 23rd\n\nA new swarm, a new cluster.  “I felt like moving away rapidly as if I had disturbed a swarm of angry bees,” as one person put it when interviewed by National Radio.\nThere had been mutterings around the city in high places about another big quake expected.  Mr Brownlee said it was a low probability, others said 50%, and my favoured probability table indicated an 85% of something up to a 6.0 in the region.  I was not too surprised when the first big one hit at 1.58pm.  I had been sort of expecting it.  I was on the second floor of a building in the suburb of Merivale, having my pre-Christmas maintenance done.  As a special treat, I was having a paraffin wax treatment on my hands, rough from gardening and cooking, when wham.  “Oh no”, says Sinai, the seasoned earthquake girl from Japan. I don’t remember getting off the bed as the room started to wildly sway.  The quake grew in size. It was a swinging motion more than the violence of previous bad ones.\nSome members of the staff were crying in the reception area, as product crashed around them from the shelves. We helped others down the stairwell and poured out into the bright sunshine of the beautiful Cantabrian afternoon.  There was another significant shock and we all moved across the road to a more open area away from buildings.  A repeat of earlier scenes from the previous big earthquakes, followed, of people clustered in groups, looking shocked, some crying, and staring in disbelief at the buildings they had just fled from and the realisation that “it” had happened again.  The traffic built up as people attempted to get to their homes.  Remembering the pattern in June, I felt instinctively there would be another big one.  However, after this big quake, there is definitely a different attitude.\nIt sounds insane now, to remember how people, after the initial shock, concentrated on getting their afternoons back in order.  After all, it was Christmas in less than 2 days and earthquakes or not, we had to get through the ‘To Do’ lists.  For me, I am embarrassed to recall, this meant getting the toenails painted.  That is, after all, what I had come for.  After being on the side of the road, trying to recover for maybe ten minutes, the shaking seemed to have stopped and I suggested to Sinai that if she was brave enough, we could go back and pick up some nail polish from the floor of the shop and paint my nails out here on the wall.  She was agreeable and so off we went, back inside.  It was a shambles but we chose some polish from the crashed products and I sat and she painted.  The ground was still wobbling, but not too badly.  She was fast and it felt mad and crazy, but positive too.  I had my red painted nails for Christmas despite all!  I hugged her, thanked her and wished her well as today was her last day in this job.  What a way for her to finish her time as a beauty therapist in Christchurch, New Zealand.  Something she will never forget!\nThe ground shook some more so I went to my car, feeling emotionally wobbly and lost.  I drove to Victoria Street where my hair appointment was supposed to be.  All the hairdressers had gone home, leaving women, I hear, with foils in their hair, standing on the pavement outside.  \nI went back to Merivale again, all the while trying to respond to texts from anxious people – children, husband, friends from overseas etc.  I actually wanted to turn my phone off and not respond to anything. I sat in the car, not sure what to do.  What about all the Christmas shopping not done yet? What about the fruit and vegetables? What about the ham and the turkey?  \nIf I can’t get my hair done at least I can get some hair product.  The Merivale salon I went into was so busy.  Product littered the floor but none of the staff had time to pick it up.  I purchase some mousse from the floor where it lies, and leave.\nThen there is another quake, much worse than the first.  I am horrified how the car is tossed from side to side, lampposts wildly swaying and buildings too, and how all the moving traffic around us is brought to an abrupt short stop.  We look around us, the drivers stunned and dazed.  Will we tip over?  The cars start to stabilise. \nSuddenly I am crying. I need human interaction.  I climb from the car and look into the eyes of the driver nearest to me, a man who gives no response.  I turn to the car behind.  A woman meets my gaze, climbs out from the driver’s seat and puts her arms around me.  I cry, she comforts and then starts telling me how over it she is.  What will I do next?  I climb back into the car.  I turn on the radio.  I can hardly bare to listen to the voice of the National Radio announcer, usually so comforting, as he talks about us, poor Christchurch people and our plight.  I do not want us, to be the subject of more earthquake news. \nShocks are on-going and I drive back to Victoria Street.  The shops are trashed this time and lovely Christmas decorations lie broken, the streets almost empty, with sirens still going off and firemen and helicopters doing their thing.  It’s a repeat, repeat, repeat.  We have been here three times before.\nI feel tired and defeated, and then I see some young staff outside another café.  Suddenly my hunger comes again and I enquire if anyone has any food.  Someone gives me a ham and tomato bap and then a shop owner, Lynn W, is standing there.  I am so happy to see her and I remember my Christmas dress, the one I was going to the city pop-up mall to pick up.  “My dress, oh I wish I had my Christmas dress.”  “But you will,” she says.  How ridiculous to be contemplating the purchase of a dress in these circumstances but it is certainly a better option than focussing on the shaking and there is this mad thought, fleeting as it is, that things might get worse and we may not even see Christmas, so why not have a bright orange celebratory dress.  “Here, have a wine,” says Lynn as she retrieves a bottle of wine from somewhere in the depths of her shaking shop.  “Sit down out here on the wall and I’ll ring and see if I can get the girls from the other shop to bring over your dress.”  And they did.  I could not believe this was possible in the circumstances.  It was amazing that her phone was working, mine wasn’t, again, a surreal combination of earth shaking and then normal activity despite it.  I felt safe with these people, mostly strangers.  The accountant from upstairs and the pale faced young boy just arrived in Christchurch by bus en-route to Dunedin, unlucky enough to be hit by two quakes as he arrived in the north of Christchurch.  He was hungry so I gave him the other half of my bap and a glass of the wine.  I could not drink mine.  The first sip had gone straight to my adrenalin-filled body.  We shook hands and he wished me well.  I wonder if he ever got to Dunedin.  Sometime, much later, the dress arrived.\nI am writing this account early on Christmas Eve, looking back at the events of the day before.  What a terribly bumpy night.  The birds are waking up.  I’ve hardly slept, so much shaking that I lost count.  Somehow Christmas Eve and its traditional activities of preparing the food for the feasting the next day, did happen, in a blur.  The family flew in from Australia and from Auckland and the trauma from the previous 24 hours was kept in control.\nNow it is Christmas night 11.30pm, I’m lying in bed in the sitting room thinking back over Christmas day 2011.  Incredibly, the day was beautiful, sunny and warm, and although a lot of shakes registered, not many were felt.  Delicious food was consumed and the weather was great for outside activities including badminton.  The highlights of the day were the balloon water fights, fantastic fun, and therapeutic as stress relief.  I am lying here now looking over my gift from daughter Aimee – Artists Impressions of New Zealand – and my attention has been arrested at the pages of Christchurch.  Looking at the beautiful images of buildings Christchurch City has left me incredulous, yet again, to realise that the detail in these buildings is all gone.  My god, it is all too weird.\nIt is indeed a second seismic Christmas with 42 new events over the Christmas Day 24 hour period.  I’m woken again Boxing Day, this time Boxing Day 2011, by yet another shake.  I feel very anxious, tonight after such a beautiful Christmas day.  Something feels lurking again and it is so strange that nearly every one of the 80 or so events since the big two on the 23rd have all registered in the same location, just off Marine Parade/ Brooklands/ Brighton, in the sea in Pegasus Bay.  \nIt seems with shakes it takes a 4 or more now for us to notice.  We’re becoming strangely reprogrammed by these constant earth movements.  Two years ago, if we had been confronted by even one isolated event of a 4 or 4.2, we would have been all talking about it.  It would have been an event.  \nI know now, that a 4.0, although distressing, is still nothing compared to the big ones.  To see the earth move in front of you so violently, the lamp posts sway, the buildings violently swing as if to touch each other then swing back, to see cars and large trucks and buses come to abrupt halts and then bounce and swing from side to side, to watch the footpath wriggle and roll, is totally unnerving.  To see people’s faces as they cope in all their different ways, some contorted with fear and screaming, others numb and calm but drained of colour, others empty, their ghost like eyes not seeing.  This level of shaking has been experienced by us all more than 7 times now , and we have, according to the Press, had an earthquake over 3 on average every four hours every day since these events began in 2010, 500 plus days at the time of writing this.\nOn the 23rd, my husband Mark was visiting the Art Gallery shop.  As he approached, he felt the movement, looked out and saw the Arts Centre moving, the buildings swaying, “surreal”, he said, from the 5.8.  He was on a mission for a Christmas card so un-deterred, he entered the shop, not surprisingly by now, the only customer.  Then the 5.3 hit and they had to evacuate.  “I’m sorry sir, those last two were over 5 and we must close the shop.”  He managed to find the card he was after, the now classic “Keep Calm Carry On” produced by the UK Ministry of Information in 1939-46 for the public morale campaign; it is now being put to good use again to boost the morale of another population in another location, 70 years later.  Mark writes on the back of this card “This card selected at 2.00pm 23rd December 2011 at the Christchurch Art Gallery Shop after a 5.8 quake, the first of a new series of quakes Christmas 2011.”\nThe gallery shop was evacuated 5 minutes later as aftershocks continued.  We are Calm and we do Carry On.\nThat is what I; along with thousands of other Cantabrians also did that day.  After waiting for the dress to arrive, I decided I was now brave enough to finish the Christmas food shopping if I found anything open, and I did.  In Victoria Street next door to a building spewing forth water and opposite others that had trashed window displays, and broken windows was a green grocer.  I saw people milling around and established they were still serving people.  So I went in.  There was a scene of calm chaos.  Whilst staff were picking up and mopping up, customers were queuing and politely making their way around them, picking up the fruit and vegetables, milk and cream etc.  I moved as quickly as I could, grabbing things, hoping that without a list I would choose what we needed.  There were 4 days of public holidays ahead with many mouths to feed and a full scale Christmas feast to prepare and 2 days after that, an engagement event for my son and daughter-in-law to be.\nWhen it shook, it was at least comforting to be with others, also doing their Christmas food shopping.  We were all mad together.  Mission accomplished, I started to feel better, knowing I had stores on board and then I had no more excuses but to head towards the Port Hills and home. I was very reluctant to see more damage at home and I did not know where Mark was.  I did not want to be at home alone.  The drive through the city revealed nothing dramatic except that some tall buildings looked on more of a lean and some areas that had been previously open, now had signs indicating they were being checked and could not be entered.  The town was again eerily quiet.  I drove on through to Sydenham.  The old stone Post Office was down, too dangerous, it had been partially demolished between the two big quakes of the afternoon.  And so to the bottom of the hill shops, the butcher boys, tired and pale, but doing a roaring trade as customers rushed to pick up Christmas meats, many with stories of fear in their families.  A woman beside me tells me she has relatives just arrived from Singapore and they are so afraid they will not enter the house.  They are huddling for comfort outside.  Others who overhear the story concur, yes, we are going to be outside too, we’ll have some more sausages please and the sausages swiftly leave the cabinet to the bags of waiting customers.  If you didn’t know there had just been two major earthquakes and you looked into this shop at this precise moment you would think you were seeing a normal pre-Christmas meat buying event.  People were calm and focused.  I purchased some small gifts in the florist and gift shop, thanking the people at each place for staying on to provide the goods so Christmas could happen.\nIt is the households in the east of the city, we think of as we raise our glasses to toast being together as a family on Christmas Day.  We feel too fortunate here in Governors Bay with the beauty of the garden and the bay surrounding us.  How will it be this time in Avonside, Bexley, Brighton and Brooklands, with the many, quakes all centred right on their doorstep; the sequence so unusual in that the shocks are consistently within a few metres/kilometres of each other.  \nThere is liquefaction for a fifth time for some.  We are so glad members of our family are no longer located in this region.  Mischa tells us that even the large trees on his old red-zoned property have given up their battle to live and succumbed to liquefaction.  When we asked him yesterday what he missed most about their old place, and he said it was the trees, especially the mature Lancewood.  Daughter in law, Sol contacted us from Barriloche in Argentina.  She and the children had arrived after an extremely long and tiring trip, the last part of the 24 hour trip being done on a bus because the airport is still closed in Barriloche from the effects of volcanic ash.  She says the ash is erupting again.  She has not told the children about the fresh spate of quakes back here.\nToday will be the Boxing Day sales 2012.  Will people run the gauntlet to go shopping!  Where will they go!  We will spend as much time as possible enjoying the outside while the weather is beautiful.  With the light each morning comes a feeling of safety again.\nThis time I do not know much about what is happening for the eastern suburbs but from media reports, I know they are suffering badly.  I know many have had no water, others no power and sewerage has been disrupted again for people in some areas and they are digging and shifting liquefaction for a fifth time.  It feels like heaven over here, compared to this. \nBetween Christmas Eve when our first guests arrived and December 30th, there were dozens of shakes but none so large as to disturb the anxious visitors.\nThen it starts again.\nDecember 30th 2011 3.00am\n\nWe all are squeezed into the beds by the window seat.  After the big hits in the last few hours, the children need to be close, not beside us on the stretchers but in bed with us.\nDecember 31st New Year’s Eve, just gone midnight. We have counted in the New Year without too much enthusiasm.  It is one week today since the last huge heaving’s and already we’re back doing relatively normal daily activity.  Today, for me, that meant doing general housework, cleaning up after the Christmas week, and readying the house for the next four days of New Year’s festivities.\nIt is as if we are living in two time zones – on one level or zone we are having so called normal daily activity and carrying on.  Work related tasks, house holding, child minding, recreating, and running concurrently and parallel to these activities is a constant awareness, alertness, a consciousness of earthquakes.  When is the next one? What will it do this time?\nI read with interest and amusement an article from the Press writer Charlie Mann, “Wobbly Ground Spooks Newcomer.”  Lyn Anderson, CEO of Orana Park, described animal reactions to the quakes.  “After the 22nd February, she described the sound of monkeys yelping in distress for three and a half hours and the image of Gregory Peck, the ostrich, running like a “crazy bugger” and the white rhinos huddled together, sitting down in the middle of the paddock  in June, the Rhinos did two complete laps of the enclosure at full run.”\nWhereas now, she says in the latest December quake, the reactions are different.  “Oh well, there’s another one.  It is no longer scary.”  Anderson says in this interview, that most of the 400 animals at the park now barely react to the aftershocks.  “It seems there is an adaptation taking place to living on shaky ground.  They haven’t fallen through the ground and the world hasn’t ended.  Clearly it’s something that initially is very different and feels like danger, but now it is just another thing.  In some ways now our animals are coping better with the events of 23rd December than our people,” she commented.\n“One day we will look back at the stories, documents and records from this seismic time and find it hard to believe any of this ever happened,” Says Press writer Phillip Matthews in an article titled “Who Were Our Local Heroes” December 24th 2011, as he reflects on the importance of material collected from writers, journalists and filmmakers.\nLike many others in Canterbury, I continue to scour the Press articles and the Geonet sites each day, searching for comfort, for answers, for more understanding about what is happening to us.  Is it getting worse as I originally feared it might?  Are our worldviews shrinking and is our pre-occupation with this tiny spot on the planet now more and more focussed and intense?\nAs I drive to Sumner via Heathcote, to do some shopping and then back to the city I find myself no longer fascinated, horrified or surprised by what I see around me on the drive, just tired, eyes and brain fatigued, it all seems too much to solve.  Thank goodness, I don’t have to be the one to solve it.\nI read some other quotes from the Press article “The Year of Tested Stamina”\n\n“Cherish the time you do have because you never know when it’s going to be up,” says Heathcote resident, Megan Lane. “No one in Christchurch will feel certain again.”  A statement made by 74 year old Jan Young after the September quake and her 80 year old  husband Ken’s comment that he wanted to “simply stay alive, and eat plenty of chocolate.”  I liked this one.\nMark and I ate a whole box between us last night, and celebrated being together, being alive, having enjoyed Christmas and having enjoyed being to Sumner to a film at the Hollywood theatre.\nRunning the gauntlet of the road between Governors Bay and Lyttelton, the tunnel to Heathcote, the causeway to Redcliffs and the narrow roadway past Clifton into Sumner we  finally reached Sumner itself, now framed by rock-face landscapes, looking clean and new in their recently re-formed states.  We move between beacons of light, as new restaurants filled with happy diners stand alone on otherwise empty lots.  The movie theatre is doing a roaring trade, small and unaffected by the shaking it continues and a fortunate restaurant on a corner just out of the fall-zone from the cliffs hovering nearby, has withstood the destruction and continues to serve delicious food to its faithful customers.\n‘A night out’ has a completely new meaning post quaking.  We feel very lucky. \nOn January 2nd I sit with some of our visitors (outside on a couch in the garden in the sun).  We are relaxed after a delicious long lunch and I ask them how it has been for them, visiting the shaking city these past few days.\nDaughter Aimee says, “I left after 22nd February and now I am back for Christmas.  It’s made me worse, coming back.  I’m not numb any more so I feel anxious all over again.  I feel angry that what should be home, the place where I come to be grounded, no longer feels safe for me.  It seems to me in my present state that there is nowhere that I can go on the planet where I will feel safe, I am angry and sad.”\nK, a visitor from Australia said she had been in one earthquake in Christchurch over 10 years ago but boarding the plane, this time via Auckland to fly to Christchurch, she said, “I was nervous.  I met a couple who had left Christchurch just before Christmas to go to Auckland to get away after the 23rd December quakes.  I was talking to these people just before we landed in Christchurch.  As we were waiting to get off the plane the guy said they had had more quakes the night before and his partner looked terrible, completely worn out, depressed, speechless, all the life gone out of her.  I felt apprehensive and curious about how it actually feels to be in these quakes.  I have also had a fear that as I land there will be a quake and what will happen to the aircraft?  After landing and seeing family I didn’t really think about it again until someone at dinner that night said, “Don’t worry, this is a safe house.”  In the middle of the night I was woken by the first quake a 5.2.  My baby kept waking, then more quakes.  I feel very vulnerable having a baby with me, wanting to protect her.  You worry if it gets bigger what should you do.  I stood up with the baby.  Not a good thing to do.  I realised then what Christchurch people had been going through.  I wanted to go on National TV and tell everyone how amazing people are in Christchurch, for carrying on.  They all deserve medals for staying here.  I wanted to make more of an effort to be extra nice to people while I was here in Christchurch.”\nGrace, now 6 years old, who had not been back since 22nd February, tells me, now on the last day of her two week holiday as we walk down Sandy Beach Road to the beach, “Well Granny, there’s been a few earthquakes, 10 or 12 or something, but I’ve still had a fablious holiday.”\nI am happy and sad at the same time.  Happy the family have come back to share in this beautiful environment for Christmas, but so sad they are leaving with another bunch of quaking memories, and probably even more resolve not to return here to live.\nListening to the adult children ‘jamming’ and singing outside on the patio area, just out of the cold wind, is a delight, a calm way to finish the day.  We’ve all been a bit subdued today, quietish with exhaustion from such a bad night.  I love having the company as we go through these crazy times.  Although it is a lot of work feeding everyone and creating enough sleeping space each night without having accessible bedrooms in the main house, it’s so good to have people to share with.  It is going to be very strange on the 4th when they all leave, so quiet, so empty, as we head into who knows what?\nHere we are climbing into bed on the 2nd night of the 3rd calendar year of the Christchurch earthquakes.  As with all nights we turn out the lights with a feeling of uneasiness, what will tonight bring?  The grandchildren on the camp bed and the window seat kiss us goodnight as we hunker down, hoping for calm but having absolutely no idea what the night will bring.\nThe darkness breeds irrational thoughts again, and I start to think about how strange now is the pattern of the quaking, all within a very small radius, under the ocean off the coast of the city and I think about previous volcanic activity again and wonder if such activity, new activity, would ever be possible again.  I wish Godlike powers could be enacted by geo science and that some definitive statements going forward could be made.\nBut that is pure fantasy and what we have is what we currently are told, which really isn’t that much.\nBetween the 7th and the 9th of January, we have some time out on the west coast but Christchurch is rocked  by 2 more quakes  over 5 . We even feel one of them during the night in Punakaiki.\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Serra Kilduff conducted shortly after the 22 February 2011 earthquake .\nMy name is Serra Kilduff and I am 37 and I was at work in Sydenham at the time of the earthquake. I was up in the lunchroom, which is one story up,  and as the shaking started I went ‘oh’ and stood up and very carefully put my food on the ground and stood there looking for something to hide under, but there is nothing in the lunchroom. But then the shaking got so bad that I ended up on the floor anyway and I ended up at the end of a couch, wedged between the sofa and the corner and I remember lunch tables flying around the room, big heavy wooden tables and people flying around the room and my boss, who has only one functional arm, upside down, with his lunch all over him and this completely stoic, surreal expression on his face, or that might have been shock actually.\nAnd when I was able to stand up again I saw all the red brick buildings in Sydenham had fallen down.\nEveryone did the earthquake drill, out of the building, assemble in the carpark and the aftershocks kept coming, but we accounted for everyone –  well-organised! There were lots of people really upset. Several people had children at Unlimited School in the centre of town and they started walking into town. It was freaky, you could hear sirens and see this huge cloud of dust and smell smoke. And silt was squirting out half way up light posts, because it was forced up the tubes and then it would find a crack or a joint  and  it would squirt out, and water was coming up, and the liquefaction, and it got worse and worse.\nWe all swapped phone numbers and then I decided to walk for home. I was really worried for a friend I know who was working in Cashel Mall and I was trying to txt her first as well as getting on Facebok to try and say ‘I am Ok, I am heading back to the port.’ So I started walking because I thought the liquefaction might get so bad, especially near Opawa and the river that I might not be able to get through, so I started walking. You couldn’t get onto Colombo street, so I just went round the block and headed for home. The traffic was crazy, you had to jump out of the way of 4-wheel drives that were driving on the foot path and cars, people running, every person you saw you said something to, you talked to.\nI helped an old lady to help her partner out of their place in Opawa. He’d got up and walked out and  then went back inside to get something and sat down and couldn’t get back up again. He was in shock  and I helped her get him back out again. Their house seemed Ok. It was quite cold as well, I moved chairs for them on the deck as they didn’t feel safe inside, so they both could sit outside. So there were all those weird little things and I saw people I knew, hugged everyone and then met up with Megan Jamieson near where the Opawa petrol station is. \nAnd we started walking. She had heard that the epicentre was in Lyttelton and that it was just gone. And her kids were over there. So she was – we were both just – yeah… And we got a ride from Opawa to Heathcote from this woman who stopped. We got to Heathcote school and there were a lot of people at the gondola.\n Megan was going to go over the hill no matter what. I knew it was going to be bad, but I decided, because I had worked in rockfall areas a lot, doing fieldwork, so I decided at the very least I could actually maybe be useful, and it would give me something to do looking after other people. And I just wanted to get home, it was really weird, something familiar, get out of Christchurch, I really wanted to get away from the city. \nSo I started walking over the Bridle path. There were heaps of people, straggling all the way down the hill which was the worst bit.\nThere were a couple of guys in trucks that were driving people up the Bridle path and we got offered lifts and I said I can walk up, no problem, give my seat to someone else. \nSo we just walked up. I kept saying to people, ‘Stay together in a group, and keep looking up, don’t stop. Even if its granny steps just keep walking.’ Coz every time there was another shake you’d hear the cracking and you’d be hearing rocks and people yelling “Rocks!” and you’d be looking and trying to find it and there’d be people pointing and you’d spot it and you’d yell to people and you’d see them look up and go ‘left or right, left or right’ and that was the worst bit ,  watching, thinking “Oh God,  I will see someone get nailed and then I will need to run down and then get up the hill again” – but we were OK and people kept stopping the last 200 metres under the summit, the big bluffs are right there, and I couldn’t stop for people . I just had to put my head down and go, and I said ‘I will see you at the top’.\nThere were heaps of cars there at the top.  And then it was only me and Megan walking from the summit down, and we went really fast down the hill. Megan had to take her little strappy office shoes off at that point to go downhill, but there was heaps of grass by the side so that was all right. \nAnd there is one Bluff where lots of rocks had fallen, and we trotted past it, coz it was kind of yukky, and I was looking and thinking “Mmm, pile of rocks, I hope I can’t see anything sticking out of that.” But I had to look as I trotted past and couldn’t see anything.\nAnd then ten minutes later we were in Lyttelton. I stayed with Megan’s for a little bit, and we had the camp stove on for a cup of tea, her kids were there, her parents had collected them, so everything was fine. And we heard from people various stuff, and people were milling around everywhere. I went up to my house and it looked ok, but I didn’t want to be there by myself. I was up Jackson’s Road and I felt a bit isolated and I caught up with my neighbours and made sure they were both ok. Then I grabbed my tent and my sleeping bag and my pack in the wardrobe all nicely ready to go and I camped out at Megan’s place for four or five nights and became honorary whanau and feel completely honoured, I feel I have this amazing friendship with her now.\n The thing that I hate the most is that it is still going. You are just trying to get back to normal and you think you are getting on top of it and it doesn’t even take another shake, suddenly you won’t be normal again, you stop sleeping again, you have a bad day where you bloody cry at everything, and you feel kind of pathetic coz … and so many other people have had worse stuff happen but somedays you just can’t deal with it. And then when you have another shake like Saturday…. I just said to a whole lot of people I really feel like I am on top of it, I really feel like moving on, they have been pulling down the old buildings and it felt as if they got rid of these old dead body buildings lying around and we can look ahead and feel positive and then ‘bang’ 5 seconds and you’re right back to the start again. So that’s hard, feeling you don’t have any reserves.\nAnd at work it’s been great to get a routine going, but I am useless.\nI think I developed some amazing friendships, I’ve got to know the community so much better. I moved to Lyttelton just over a month before the September earthquake, so I’m a newbie. And I think Lyttelton, like a lot of smaller settlements, there are oldies and newbies, different cliques that don’r necessarily mix, and I think that has been broken down to an extent, partly by such things as there only being one place in town to drink and so everyone is at the club. So suddenly you are talking to those old guys that are 4th generation and it’s awesome, it’s really cool.  \nAnd working at the rec-centre for 2 weeks that was really good for meeting people. I think in some ways people recognise me now as well , they say “Oh yea, she worked at the rec centre’ and even if they’re not ‘Oh yeh, she’s a local.’ I’m aknowledged as someone who lives here. I’ve always been very transient my whole live, so it’s amazing to be part of a community, it’s really cool, coz it can be hard to get into a community. Yeah, so I think friendship and community have been really amazing. And I am so utterly impressed by how Lyttelton is. Lyttelton sticks together and gets on with stuff. They put their head down and go ‘Yup!’,  sharing shop space and … I think all over Christchurch it has been like that. I think it has made people reevaluate friendships. People are saying they love each other and give each other hugs.\n I like the sign ‘Keep calm and carry on’ which is originally from the Blitz, I love how it has proliferated and become Christchurch’s, and of course it’s an English thing as well. But I have also seen another version of it which is “ Run around in small circles, scream and skull whiskey.’ and I think that has its place as well. There is a group of us that has got together to have glasses of wine … and the music gigs have been really important, it’s been amazing to go to gigs at Naval Point. There is something to be said for having a good hoolie, and having a good blow-out, not necessarily alcohol-fuelled, but there are not many valves and there is a lot of pressure! \nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton .  We are very grateful to Bettina and the interviewees for allowing their interview transcripts to be posted on QuakeStories.",

        "text": "Hi, I was working when the September Quake hit, in Lyttelton. I was on a Ship berthed in the Port, when the rumbling sound started and just kept building, at first I thought the ship was “breaking up” and started running around to escape-to no avail, everything shock like crazy, placing myself in a doorway I tried to brace myself, then saw someone run past and decided to follow them out onto deck, stopping at the side of the Ship.\nI then witnessed the Harbour Water rising and falling up to a Metre then it just went quiet. With the rumbling sound carring on[maybe rocks falling outside the Tunnel City side. Hearing no screams or other damage decided that it was OK? and went to bed as my shift had finished, the second “shock” hit in the morning I went home [Lyttelton is my “Home-Port”] only then did I realise the extent of what had happened, with big cracks and Bridges “Munted “on my way to my House in Brighton, in some ways it was exciting and scary, with no Deaths it seemed Ok to feel this way.\nFeburary was a way lot different, I was in Wellington, and was told by another Crew member from Christchurch that “there has been another big Quake and the City has been destroyed, and People had been killed” first reaction was shock. Immediately I tried to get hold of family and my Partner as she works at the IRD in the City, all the lines were busy and took a while to get hold of them, my partner was very distressed as was my Sister.\nMy employer was great said to us go home, Murray Dickson [our employer] and our Union did everything in their power to try-but no flights to Christchurch.\nWe managed to get a Rail Ferry crossing at 6 pm that night and  then started to see how things were down there on the news and the Net, a Guy [Brett] from Master Pet Foods, asked if we were from CHCH and said get a ride with him, great man, this was my first “taste” of how our Community was going to “Gel together”, my Crew Mate only got hold of his Son at about 11pm, poor bugger was so upset, and was a very quiet trip down to Home, finally arriving at 2am to my place with everything on the floor, crazy, and surreal as no power and total silence. So much more to tell but would have to have been the most stressfull moment I have been in, to see what has happened to Lyttelton [I was born there] and the City is still hard to comprehend to this day, but I think it will create one of the most wonderfull City’s as the people of Christchurch have come together and shown that the most important things is a sense of community spirit and caring for others.",

        "text": "(Written October 2010, prior to the more devastating February quake)\nI’m from Wellington, you see – I should have expected it. I should have remembered that earthquakes are no respecters of sleep or readiness. I should have remembered the quiet times are just in between. But after nine years in the quiet flatlands of Christchurch I had become complacent. After all, earthquakes were Wellington’s curse; the ground never moved here. \nOr more truthfully, I can remember perhaps two or three earthquakes since I arrived, all of which were pointed out by other people, since they were so small I failed to notice them. It wasn’t like the many trembles a year (or sometimes month) that goes with living in Wellington. So to be shunted out of a deep 4.30am sleep by a magnitude 7.1 came as a genuine shock.\nSix years ago, when my husband and I bought our turn-of-the-century worker’s cottage in Belfast in north-western Christchurch, I was still alert to the possibility of earthquake. I stored a dozen milk bottles’ worth of clean water. I remembered to wire a heavy bookcase to doorframes either side of its hallway spot. I remembered not to hang pictures over beds. I thought about blu-tacking our heavy ornaments – vases, figurines – to their shelves, but never quite got to it.\nBut I had never discussed a disaster plan with my husband, let alone rehearsed what to do.\n\nUnder great stress, people lose their ability to think clearly: perhaps as much as eighty percent of what our rational mind has learned can disappear at once, leaving only our baser instincts for dealing with immediate dangers. My father-in-law had the presence of mind to turn off the water mains and the appliances, but in this he was unusual. Other people ran out into their yard because they had heard that open ground was the safest place to be. Not one person I’ve spoken to had a disaster plan.\n——-\nThe violence of the quake woke me immediately. I bolted out of bed, heading straight for our children. I expected my husband to be right behind me, so we could grab a child each and find a doorframe to cower in. But, thinking slightly differently (as he does), he headed straight for a doorframe and stayed there, wanting to be as alive as possible to look after everyone else when it was over. \nI’m told the quake lasted forty seconds, although I’m sure it was three quarters of forever. The roaring was enormous. Our children share a room, and from it I could see their door and the dining room door opposite swinging wildly open and closed. It’s hard to say now exactly how frightened I was, but I think “badly” covers it.\nWithout my husband right behind me, I froze. I could not think clearly enough to decide which child to go to first, or how to get them both into a safe position. I defaulted to holding onto our five-year-old son, simply because he was sitting up when I got there. I didn’t do any of the things I’ve heard keep you safe. I didn’t take him to the doorframe; I didn’t duck and cover; I didn’t lie down with him beside or under the bed. I have taught him nothing of use about surviving an earthquake. \nOur two-year-old daughter woke after several seconds of shaking and sat up, and I couldn’t move to get her. Like her big brother, she sat calmly until the shaking stopped. One of our many good fortunes has been the resilience of our kids; Miss Two hardly seems to know anything unusual has happened; Master Five thinks it’s all an adventure to be welcomed, even if “the storm” was a bit scary and lots of buildings are “broken”.\nWe even retained our electricity initially. In checking for damage after the first quake, we opened the front door to find the whole street alive with house lights, and half the city’s car alarms blaring. (We laughed. As you do when you’ve just escaped possible annihilation. For a moment, it was hard not to feel like we were in a blockbuster movie just after an explosion or a superhero chase.)\nThe second or third aftershock took the power out, and we had to improvise a nightlight for the kids. Miss Two fussed and cried with each aftershock until she fell asleep; Master Five tried to comfort her each time by calling out “it’s ok, bubba, it’s just a little one.” He surprised us with his calmness, as the earthquake house in Te Papa had scared him when we’d visited some months previously, and he was determined not to go back to Wellington because of it.\nMy husband, lucky man, was able to go back to sleep. Anxious, I lay in the total darkness, listening to the approaching rumble of each new aftershock until the sun came up, and then I got up to clear the mess.\n——\nAnother of our good fortunes has been the lack of damage we’ve suffered. Sum total of items broken inside the house: one spice jar. Sum total of items broken outside the house: two chimneys. And we had to take those down ourselves, after discovering we could see daylight through them. Amazingly, given they were held together with the old sand and limewash mortar, only one brick fell down.\nAs my husband and his father climbed up to the roof and tossed bricks onto the lawn, something of the house’s hundred-year-old charm disappeared too. The stumps left behind seem amputated, bandaged in polythene to keep the weather out.\nTo begin with, we did our best not to rubberneck. We took a walk around our neighbourhood on the Saturday morning, checking on those we knew and having a sneaky look around for damage. There wasn’t much to be seen. By Sunday we’d driven a bit further afield, finding at least one road that had acquired some interesting ructions in the tarmac. \nMy husband was able to return to work on Monday, and discovered that their warehouse, stacked full of pumps and pump parts, had suffered amazingly little damage. He cycled there and back for the rest of the week, as road closures caused lengthy traffic jams along his usual route.\nBy Thursday, the bad weather had given us all cabin fever, but this wasn’t the reason we started driving around to find the damage we’d heard about. We were now part of a major historical event; it was weaving into our personal histories, and we needed to hear other stories, see other buildings, move the bruised landscape of Christchurch city from our imaginings into the recordings of our senses. We would have no compelling stories to offer, either now or to future listeners, without contextualising our own tiny experience into the fullest picture we could manage.\nAnd, besides, we didn’t want to have seen the damage only through media coverage.\n\nWe were reluctant to intrude on anyone’s privacy, though, so we looked around the public buildings. These belong to all of us; once they have been fenced off and the debris swept or bulldozed aside, once public safety is assured, we all have a right to look and grieve over them in our own way.\n—-\nI’ve learned a lot from this disaster. I’ve learned that the soil structure can strongly affect the outcome for the people living on top of it. I’ve learned about liquefaction and sand geysers. I’ve discovered that the disturbance of the earth’s plates can affect the inner ear; for days I have felt like I’m walking on a boat, and it seems I’m not the only one. \nI’ve learned that pets are not necessarily the quake predictors they are said to be. My sister-in-law’s young Labrador woke up as each quake hit, then just went back to sleep. (Clearly this is much less important to him than the arrival of his dinner.)\nI’ve learned about miracles. Haiti’s quake killed an estimated two hundred and thirty thousand; Christchurch’s killed none. Parts of the Port Hills shed rocks ranging in size from “ouch” to house-sized; not a single home was touched. Most of our beautiful heritage buildings have suffered damage, but many will be able to be fully restored. And we’ve gone from rescue to recovery in just one week.\nI’ve learned that human reserves of fortitude are deep but not unlimited; the continuing aftershocks have for many been harder to cope with than the initial quake. Fear, hyper-vigilance and sleep deprivation have stretched many people’s inner resources to paper thinness (my husband is only half-joking when he refers to it as “the natural disaster that keeps on giving”).\nAnother thing I’ve learned about, and this one has been especially important, is the community of survivors. We have all been through a terrible and terrifying event, and we find a particular kind of comfort in listening to each other’s stories of destruction and loss. Strangers chat freely, overhear, join in. Most listen openly to each other and interruptions are few. And no matter how dreadful the loss we discuss, we come away relieved all over again that we are still alive.\nAs you might expect during difficult times, there has been a lot of bad behaviour. The number of domestic violence incidents has risen drastically, as has the number of burglaries. Stress is causing many to verbally lash out at others over small irritations. Some are using the quakes as cover for taking time off work to play or party. \nBut greater kindness is present too. After the first quake, neighbours checked on or rescued each other, or offered blankets or company to keep away the cold. Many whose houses are still intact are offering rooms and door keys to friends, or sometimes strangers. A good friend in Wellington sent us a “ration pack for the soul,” and I can say for certain that chocolate biscuits have never tasted so good. \nAnother dear friend in the Waikato said she thought this would be a great wake-up call for the rest of the country, that more people might now stock up with emergency supplies and equipment. I don’t feel quite so hopeful. Memory is short. Gisborne was rocked in 2007 and suffered both damage and casualties; Edgecumbe’s big shake in 1987 was seriously destructive. How many of us who can remember these were properly prepared for this one?",

        "text": "My husband and I moved to Christchurch with our 4 children on the 1st January 2010, our kids are Harrison age 18, Duncan age 15, Benjamin age 13 and Violet age 10. We found a wonderful house in Mt Pleasant, Harrison began Canterbury University, Duncan and Benjamin started Linwood College and Violet began Mt Pleasant Primary School. My husband Bill, and I began new routines as we established our new lives in Christchurch. \nBy the beginning of September 2010, our kids had started making new friends and on the 3rd September 2010 Benjamin had 3 teenage boys staying over for the night. We had pizza and xbox games, fun and laughter, Bill and I went to bed about 10pm and told the kids they could stay up late if they were quiet.\nSeptember 4th 4.30am I woke up to a roaring noise, thinking that the kids had turned the TV up incredibly loud.  I climbed out of bed, started walking towards the bedroom door but before I got 3 steps I was knocked off my feet by the floor violently shaking. I yelled at Bill and started screaming what’s happening? \nBill got to the doorway and said it must be an earthquake, we could hear our daughter screaming and crying, we couldn’t get to her. We live in a multi story house, once the shaking stopped we got to her and made sure she was safe then in the dark moved carefully downstairs to the lounge, Benjamin and his friends were sitting in the lounge scared but okay. \nHarrison and Duncan sleep downstairs, but hadn’t come up Bill and I had no torches, no light and started arguing over who should check on them. Within moments both boys came up the narrow stairwell from their rooms to the lounge, they were also fine.\nWe started thinking what’s happening it was dark outside and we couldn’t tell what the extent of the damage was outside – we huddled in the lounge and waited for light.\nWhile we waited for the sunrise we checked twitter and TVNZ websites for information.\nThe children that were staying over called their parents, they were all safe and were staying put in there homes till they knew more as well. We looked after our kids and the house visitors till mid morning when it became clear we were in for a long day… little did we know what the next 11 months would bring.",

        "text": "A Very Happy Story:\n\nThe September and February earthquakes have taught me some surprising things about myself.  I’ve been surprised at how resilient I am.  At the time of the September quake I was a solo parent of two, and a university student.  On the Friday night we also had an international (home-stay) student with us, and a young girl having a sleep over with my children.  Being the only adult in the house when the quake struck was probably a good thing.  I acted calmly, although filled with adrenalin, getting the kids out of their beds to stand in the door-frames.  I’m not sure how I would have coped had there been another adult (older or male) in the house.  I may have been more scared, deferring the protective role to them rather than assuming it myself.  \nIn any case, the kids weren’t afraid, they were excited – which probably also helped me cope as well as I did.  After about 5.30am we all went back to bed.  I was so tired that I treated the rocking bed as though I was being rocked back to sleep.  I wasn’t afraid of the aftershocks, tiredness overrode any fear.  Sleep never came however, as the cellphone kept buzzing with txts and the occasional call that made it through.  We had damage to possessions, but no structural damage to the house, so we were very lucky.  The power came back on sometime in the afternoon I think.\nAs the school and university were closed I decided to send the kids (including our international student) to my parents’ house in Central Otago.  My children finished off the term at school there before returning to Christchurch.  I stayed behind and offered to help clean up for neighbours and friends.  During this time an old friend (and lover) got in touch with me to make sure I was OK.  We kept in touch.  As the weeks passed with continual aftershocks, I became quite emotional with anxiety and stress over the shakes.\nStrangely, when the February quake occurred, I didn’t feel afraid for my children, even though we were separated with them being at school and myself at home.  I had complete confidence in their school being a safe environment and the teachers acting professionally.  In hindsight, I still don’t really understand why I didn’t panic, but I imagine it might be something of a coping mechanism.  \nI wasn’t aware of the tragic loss of life in the CBD until much later in the day when we listened to the radio.  Even then, it didn’t seem real.  I was fine, my house was fine, my kids were fine, therefore it was just so difficult to comprehend how others in the very same city could have had such a vastly different experience of the same event.  Once the power came back on we were all glued to the television.  We just couldn’t believe the devastation in the images on the screen.\nAfter the February earthquake I decided that I would take the kids and go down south with them to avoid going through that awful series of aftershocks and the stress of being on edge all the time.  Once again, the schools and university were closed, so we really didn’t know how long we would be away from home for with no real reason to come back.  While our home was safe, I wasn’t keen to stay and endure the aftershocks.  When university finally opened I was very anxious about returning.  My children stayed on at school in Alexandra for the rest of the term.  I returned to Christchurch to continue my studies.  I had let another family stay in our house while we were away and it was strange to come back and feel like a guest in my own home.  They eventually moved on however.\nI think, the story above is probably quite typical for anyone living in the Western part of Christchurch.  However, what happened next is extraordinary!\nI was successful in gaining a place at the University of Oxford for a term as part of a ‘student transfer’ offer they had made to help the University of Canterbury!  As the quakes had destroyed my ex-husband’s businesses, he was then in a position to care for our children full-time to allow me to go to Oxford.  It was the most amazing series of circumstances that enabled me to have the opportunity of a lifetime!  I absolutely loved the Oxford experience, it was unforgettable!   One very odd thing about it was that for the first few weeks I experienced something like post-traumatic-stress syndrome and had panic attacks every time a bus or a train rumbled past and vibrated the ground.  My reaction to those sensations seemed much worse than my reaction to the aftershocks back home!  Thankfully that passed.\nNow, as if going to Oxford University wasn’t life-changing enough – another wonderful thing has come into my life as a direct result of the earthquakes.  My man-friend who got in touch after the September quake needed a place to stay after he returned from the USA.  As my house was empty (with me in Oxford and my children with their father), I agreed to let him move in while I was away.  Once I returned, however, he still hadn’t found anywhere else to stay so he became our boarder.  A few months later our relationship became romantic once more.  Long story short, I’m no longer a solo parent, and we are a very happy family of four.   It’s been almost  a year since I returned from Oxford and it’s incredible how different my life is now.  I feel as though I’ve received everything I ever wanted.  My life and the lives of my children are better in so many little ways now that I have a loving, supportive partner.  If the September quake hadn’t occurred we probably wouldn’t have gotten back in touch.  If the February quake hadn’t occurred, I wouldn’t have gone to Oxford, he wouldn’t have gone to the US and then needed somewhere to stay on his return, and it’s highly unlikely that we would be living happily together today.\nSo, for me, the terrible earthquakes have brought nothing but wonderful opportunities into my life.",

        "text": "It is Sunday June 12th and I am uneasy…. Tomorrow I will leave Christchurch;  my husband will look after our 5 year old and 14 month old while I travel to Nelson and Blenheim for 3 days for work.\nI can’t tell you why I am uneasy  – is it because it is a month since our last “over 5.0 mag” aftershock,  is it because this is the first time since Feb 22nd I have left my family?... I just  know I am on edge; my ears straining at each sound, jumping when neighbours slam car doors or garages and I develop a morbid fascination with Geonet again checking it constantly.\nAround 4pm my husband comments to me that he too is uneasy and “thinks we are in for another big one”. I snap at him not wanting to put the words “out there” and then admit to my own uneasiness so we put a plan in place for him to get to the children at School and Daycare if something should happen while I am away.\nMonday June 13th and at 7:45am I am on my way to Nelson;  keen to get there, get the job done and back home again.\nI arrive in Motueka around 12:45pm with my first appointment at 1pm and I quickly make some phone calls then check Geonet again. All is quiet… only some little ones….\nI get to the door of my appointment and realise I have left my cell in the car.  I go back to get it and put it in my pocket.\nInside I am greeted by the salon owner and we sit down. For some reason my hand goes to my pocket and I pull out my phone and place it beside me, something I never do.\nShe asks me if I am expecting a call and apparently (I am told later) I say “No” but nod my head as if to say “Yes”.\nWithin 3 minutes it rings and I glance at the number – it is my husband calling- so I politely ask if it is possible to take the call.\n“We’ve just had a fu*ken big one!”  He yells down the phone. My stomach drops to the floor; I can feel all the blood drain from my body and all the hairs rise up on my skin. The owner has obviously heard his voice and her face turns to concern as I croak out the words “How big?” in panic.\nHe thinks it is around a 5.5-5.8 magnitude and my heart turns to stone as I try to comprehend the implications, timelines and how far away I am from him and my babies.\nI hang up and frantically dial Daycare – I know it is a new building and I am sure they will be ok but . . . PHEW! Apparently he has slept through it.  My heart slows down slightly as I hear the news while another part of me registers the soft click of a text message coming through.\n“All kids are OK but in the interests of safety we ask you to collect your child from school” \nMy husband tells me he will pick our 5 year old up… But the message really undoes me… If school is evacuating then it is definitely a big one and I am going home! Forget work; I can’t concentrate, my mind is spinning and all I want is to see my husband and babies.  I know that will be it for the day… there will be smaller aftershocks after this and with earthquakes and nearly ten months of subsequent aftershocks I know how terrifying, frightening and nerve shattering it is to be in one but today for me this is much worse –  being so far away from my family and not being able to see they are safe with my own eyes is threatening to undo me and I try to remain calm and think rationally.\nI leave the salon and head to the petrol station, kicking myself for wasting precious time getting back on the road. The attendant tells me there has just been another big quake in Christchurch and my voice wobbles as I tell him I have just driven up this morning and am turning around to drive back again to get to my family.\nAs I go to pay, grabbing a drink and sandwich he takes my mobilcard but declines money for the food and tells me to drive safely.\nI drive through Wakefield and suddenly remember my accommodation so I call them apologising for the inconvenience of cancelling at such short notice. They tell me not to worry, they will see me next time adding that I am the fifth person to cancel in the last half hour as people rush back to Christchurch which leads me to thinking how the quakes are affecting people and businesses all over New Zealand in many ways.\nIt is the longest drive of my life especially when there is no coverage through the Lewis Pass for me to check what is happening on my iPad or cell and as I drive into Murchison I break road laws and take another call from my husband…. “We’ve just had an even bigger one – probably as big as Feb!!!!” \nI scream down the phone at him to go and pick up our 14 month old “NOW!” and am crying telling him I am getting there as fast as I can.\nI run out of cell coverage again and try to find a radio station but get only static. \nMy heart is hammering wildly in my mouth; I just want to get home and have to make myself slow down as time and time again the speedo on my car jumps above 130kph.\nI pray that no-one has been injured or killed again and wonder just how much more Christchurch and it’s people can take\n“Logically” we knew after a 7.1 on September 4th that there would be aftershocks but we all thought that “logically” it couldn’t get worse … then Feb 22nd hit with the vengeance of a 6.3 and life changed in Christchurch for us all forever. \nNow “illogically” we have had a major aftershock followed just an hour and a half later with an even bigger aftershock – everything that your brain “logically” tells you won’t/shouldn’t happen just has.\nAt Amberley I stop to refuel unsure if there is power on in Christchurch or shops open. The service station is really busy and I grab bread, milk and water and am unsettled again as I realise that most of the people are obviously from Christchurch – cars are filled with people, sleeping bags, animals and I notice liquefaction mud/sand half way up jeans, bare legs and cars.\nI drive into Christchurch down the Main North Road – it all looks so peaceful and normal – until I  glance in shop windows and notice posters hanging lopsidedly; mannequins fallen over, broken windows (again) and shelves emptied of stock onto the floor.\nThere is queue after queue outside fish and chips shops and at the Papanui/Harewood Road intersection I notice a set of shops already broken from Feb are far worse off then what they were this morning.\nI skid to a halt at home and run inside to my family. I give them all a big hug but try to act “normally” so as not to unsettle further my 5 year old.\nHe tells me he was playing outside at lunchtime when the first one hit at school and how they all ran to the centre court to find their teacher and how he waited for Daddy to pick him up.\nI can only be grateful once again that this time there are no casualties but mourn once again the further loss of homes, buildings  and my once beautiful city under the strength of Mother Nature’s temper.",

We turned on the radio straight away – it was still going hours later when we woke up.  That was when I opened the front door to a moonscape, a grey mess sweeping down and into the garage which had a layer of silt.\n4 September was Open Day at the new CCC (Christchurch City Council) building.  I was picked up at 10am.  We made our way over cracks and bumps in Halswell.  Everything looked normal along Hilmorton and Lincoln Road until we wanted petrol at Shell Barrington but there was a jam of cars wanting to be filled.  The scene into the city looked normal, except for the odd pile of red bricks fallen from older buildings.  The brand new CCC building would withstand an earthquake.  “Park under the Art Gallery,” I suggested.  Hello, the door is closed, a man in a bright vest at the entrance.  “Drive around to the Hereford Street entrance”, I suggest.  Hello, white notices are taped onto the windows telling us the building is closed because of the earthquake.  “Come to the Art Gallery”, I urged, “there are some wonderful sculptures I’d like you to see”, our way was barred once again.  It was to be the penultimate day of their exhibition.  I hope the sculptures are alright; some of them are kinetic and I did not hear anything of their fate.\nSo we made our way back to Halswell, joining the queue for petrol en route, seeing the piles of silt starting to appear at the kerb.\nTime to start work on the sand volcanoes at my place.",

        "text": "On February 22 I wasn’t even in Christchurch. My company was hosting a large conference in Rotorua and our Office Manager and I had just walked into the Convention Centre. She answered her mobile and I heard her say “yes, we are fine” in a puzzled voice. Turns out that our office phone is diverted to her mobile if it is not answered and someone was phoning to see if we were OK. They said there had been a big aftershock, and we both thought “oh yes, another bloody 5”, and they will have all had to traipse down 7 flights of stairs and hang around till the all clear is given.  We had done that a number of times since September, so were not at all worried. Almost immediately we had a call from our accountant Steve, who said “we are all out and we are OK”. It began to register then that this was something much bigger. We were so pleased we got that call as we knew everyone back at work was OK, but now we had 10 staff from Christchurch in Rotorua, all worried about their families. \nAs news spread people gathered round, laptops were fired up and we received lots of hugs we struggled with the phone networks. We gradually could start ticking people off as staff got through to families. News was coming in, the cathedral was down, the new tower at the airport had collapsed (incorrect), buildings were down, people were dead. TV3 were based in the same building as us and they started to film from just outside on Kilmore Street. We could see the liquefaction, which was very bad on our part of the street, we could also see our building, still standing (we think now it will be demolished, it has sunk half a metre and now leans towards Manchester Street). We heard that the PGC building which was just in front of our building had collapsed- our insurance brokers were based there, we knew people who worked there, wondered what had happened to them (we found out later 3 had died, including our broker- 24 hours earlier we had had a cuppa and talked through business interruption insurance- should we review it after September’s events? Too late now- was left feeling guilty that I had not made the appointment for 24 hours later so he would not have been in the building). All the time no word from my family- was almost sure husband would not have been in the CBD, but he travels with his work, could be anywhere in Canterbury. Eventually a missed call came through- relief he had tried to phone, followed by panic as I am in his phone as “In case of emergency” what is it was, and it was not him phoning”. Then a text from son’s Principal “are you Ok?”, yes I screamed at the phone I am OK, but what about my son. Principal did not realise I was away and was worried as knew my part of town had been hit hard. Eventually an age later a quick call- husband was home, the house was still standing and he was walking to the school. Sometime later another quick call- conversation with Mr 10, he was all OK, had fallen down, but fine. Helped look after younger pupils, was all very grown up.\nAs one of the bosses I had to also think about what taking 10 staff out of the conference team would do, but everyone was wonderful. Additional staff drove in from all parts of the North Island to take over our duties and we hear the conference was a great success.\nIn the meantime wonderful PA and travel agents working behind the scenes to look at how to get is home. Rental cars not an option, could not take them to chch, drive to Wellington, ferry, then ? no train, no rental cars in Picton. Lots of ideas, not many choices. Eventually 2am flights comfirmed, be at airport 6.45am.\n3.30am text I had been waiting for- friend’s husband rescued from roof of Forsythe Barr builidng and safe- he had been for hours, but phone network still overloaded.\nFitful sleep- checking geonet and quake.crowe for new shakes, and then up to airport. Then wait and wait. Stocked up on bread and milk on the way- not sure why but felt we were doing something. Finally 11.15am we took off. Felt so good to be heading in the right direction. Did not last long- the poor man next to me got very emotional talking about his family, next thing out with the angina medicine, and then full blown heart attack. Luckily a nurse on board who was wonderful. The plane was turned round and we landed with the patient on the floor, me holding the oxygen bottle and the nurse who was sitting sideways. Air NZ wonderful, patient offloaded (by then coming round and looked him he was going to be OK), back in air in 10 minutes. Down to Wellington and wait again- connection  missed, so a few hours waiting in the lounge as more and more planes delayed and cancelled. All planes grounded as they brought in Air Force planes with tourists being evacuated from Christchurch- most with no luggage, not quite the holiday they had planned. Suddenly my flight called, no delays, on and up in the air. Was full of USAR and rescue workers heading South to help us. We cheered and cried, thank them for whatever help they could give us.\nWe landed into chaos, airport packed with people trying to get out, collected car and drove home. Surreal, the Western part of the city looked OK, few chimneys down, odd garden wall, but on the whole OK. Changed as I headed close to home- road badly damaged, silt everywhere, and finally home. Husband and son in the street with shovels. 18 inches of silt in street, more in garden, none inside house, but badly damaged.\nHugged and hugged, never want to let them go. Inside to collect what we can-few clothes, important papers, look for cats (put down food just in case they come home) and head for the relative sanity of North Canterbury. Refugees out there for a month- water, toilets, electricity, limited shaking. Luxuries. Back each day to try to clean up, eventually move back home and wait.\nHouse will be demolished, still waiting on news re the land, but not looking good. A year we will never, ever forget, but we got through and we still have each other. We are one of the lucky ones.",

I was standing on a large tyre and when the quake started, it was hardly felt but then the tyre slowly started swaying and all i could hear was creaking sounds from the trees. Everyone including the teachers just thought it was another aftershock but then texts from loved ones started flowing in.  We all gathered into a big hall and everyone was checking for geonet updates on their phones. All i could think about was my family because none of them were replying to my texts. \nWhen we heard the news that it was a shallow 6.3, there were a lot of tears in the room. Rumours were everywhere like, “The city is on fire” and “thousands have died already.” All that was on my mind was what if my family were part of those thousand. A bus came out to Waipara and it then took us 3 hours to get back to Christchurch. I finally got texts back from my family and a lot of the stress was gone especially since my dad works on Moorhouse Ave. When I got back to my brothers house, my Dad was there to and they were watching the news. They were both happy to see me okay. Then we got a knock on the door from my aunty who works in the city. She was in shock and It was easy to tell. \nFinally I went home to Rangiora with Dad and he dropped my aunty off in Amberley. I was so glad to be in Rangiora where I felt safe there being away from the worst of it. This earthquake has changed my life and is something I can tell my own children, nieces and nephews about.",

        "text": "22 February 2011 12.50pm:  At work in Lyttelton and it was time for my lunchtime walk.  Outside my office there were lots of tourists as a cruise ship was in port for the day.  I overheard some Scottish tourists discussing lunch, possibly getting fish and chips from the shop across the street.  I crossed over Canterbury Street, walked under Freemans restaurant verandah and suddenly the earth beneath me started violently shaking.  The noise became deafening, bricks from the top storey of Freemans started falling down, I ran out into the middle of London Street but then masonry started falling off Ground cafe across the road.  I watched as Volcano Cafe started disintegrating, the fish and chip shop frontage fell onto the street and the lamp posts were snapping backwards and forwards.  The noise of the earth and the falling buildings gradually subsided, there was a brief moment of deathly silence and then the screaming started.  \nThe Asian family who operated the fish and chip shop came running out into the street distraught.  My work colleagues came running out of our offices (in the Lyttelton Library building) and we gathered with other people in the middle of the intersection of Canterbury / London Streets.  I immediately texted my partner, son in New Plymouth and sister in Auckland “Alive”.  Within a few minutes the aftershocks started.  I found myself standing with the Scottish tourists (who were actually from Australia) explaining that this is what was going to happen now – continuous aftershocks.  They were shocked and terrified but appreciated my explanation.  \nWe moved away from manhole coverings in the intersection as brown water started seeping out from under some of them.  Then to the St John Ambulance building where someone started distributing some lukewarm tea despite the power going off.  The volunteer Fire Brigade members managed to get their engines out of their badly damaged building. The rest of the afternoon was spent:\n\nI ducked back into my office between aftershocks to retrieve my handbag and jacket/coat.\n\nContinually texting my partner Ian who was trying to get home from Sockburn.\n\nMoving up to outside the Recreation Centre Civil Defence post.\n\nNoticed that the Army were arriving setting up equipment.\n\nA couple across the road from the Rec Centre gave out welcome cups of tea and when I enquiried how with no power – they smiled and said they had a fire – thank goodness.\nThe weather became cool, several people were getting cold and blankets and rugs appeared.\nWe watched people running down the Bridle Path returning to Lyttelton from the city side and discussed getting home that way. We heard the tunnel was closed as well as Sumner Road.  \nWe heard on a car radio that devastation had happened in the city and I said to a friend, “there has got to be deaths this time”.  \nThe Scottish tourists assisted people at the Recreation Centre but I never saw them again.\nWith work colleagues we discussed getting home via Dyers Pass. Ian decided to try his luck to get home to Tai Tapu via Gebbies Pass and texted at Governors Bay that the road seemed to be open but lots of cracks and boulders would need to be avoided.  We decided to travel in convoy together and slowly set off from Lyttelton at 5.30pm with other vehicles joining us as we travelling around the bays to Governors Bay.  Then up Dyers Pass Road slowly and carefully around giant boulders on the road.  At the top coming over the pass, the city looked  like a mini 9/11 with smoke and dust shrouding the buildings. Tears flowed but I had to concentrate as I was alone in my vehicle, following Ken and the others in theirs. At the bottom we headed right into Centaurus Road and then the others turned off to head to their homes westwards. I continued through the Heathcote in a huge line of slow but moving traffic.  \nPeople were setting themselves up on the footpaths with tents etc.  Our faces showed the shock we were going through but also the concentration needed to cope with what we had to do.  The rail bridge in Martindales Road looked very damaged but we were all driving under it – pause and take a deep breath before it, allow a little gap to the vehicle in front and then, race through – phew, made it!  Then along the road at the bottom of the valley and up Cannon Hill.  Nearly home, our beautiful Mt Pleasant is devastated.  I need to see our home.  I know my partner is already there safe.  Its nearly 6.30pm and finally I turn into our little street.  There’s Ian talking to a neighbour, I know he needs to hug me but I just want to see the damage. So a little hug and then inside – so much is on the floor. I quickly grab the camera and take the necessary photos, shutting the fridge and freezer doors.  Quickly, the night will soon come.  Grab some food and get the BBQ going Ian – thawed chicken kebabs will do.   Our neighbour Frauke calls out – “we are going down to the school with the tent for the night – come too”.  Yes, great idea, pack up our little tent, grab a few clothes and some thawed food and we head down to what has become ‘tent city” in the grounds of Mt Pleasant school.  Everyone is more or less left to get themselves organised, no one person is in charge and the hedge and some tyres become public latrines.  \nEventually we lie down on the ground in our sleeping bags and are shuddered and rocked all night with the accompanying rock noise coming up from the earth.  I manage to sleep between the big ones.   Back to the house next morning, we contact our friend in Methven and decide to go leaving our house with no power, water, sewerage, telephone and only some initial cleaning up done.  \nThe next 3 weeks were spent staying at friends’ houses in Methven and Rangiora.  My partner  had to return to work urgently and I took the time to travel into Mt Pleasant almost every day to gradually get our house cleaned up using water from a neighbour’s swimming pool, purchasing solar showers, finding break and milk etc and checking regularly on a few neighbours who stoically stayed put.  All the while the aftershocks rocked through, we yelled profanities at it but then within a minute returned back to the work at hand.  Mt Pleasant residents eventually got power back in 10 days.  When water returned in the system almost two weeks afterwards, we discovered leaks in out toilet and hot water pipes.  A builder working next door, managed to grab a passing plumber off the road and we were so fortunate to get these temporarily repaired.  We moved back home then and used water from a tanker at the school, boiling it up for drinking purposes for quite a few weeks thereafter.  Civil Defence personnel visited 10 days after the quake and our neighbourhood requested portaloos.  These arrived eventually 6 weeks later approximately.   We had no support from Red Cross*, EQC, Salvation Army, food deliveries, letterbox drops with information, hot meals delivered by helicopters as happened in other suburbs.  We did not seem to exist to emergency services and had to very much rely on our own resilience and resources to get through, thank goodness for our little radio.  Mt Pleasant was shown to be the worst affected suburb in numbers of EQC claims.  \nWe lost 60% of our residents but EQC have finally authorised temporary plywood coverings of many houses now and lights are starting to appear as people move back in.  It is wonderful to see them return.  However, our neighbour has still not been able to move back in as her house was completely flooded by a hot water cylinder fall and she has been unable to get repairs completed despite weekly phone calls to EQC and Fletchers.  We look forward to that day.  \nBang – another aftershock as I write this.  \n\n13 June 2011:   Virtually another repetition of the above as I am standing in virtually the same place as 22 February.  Cannot believe it and cannot hold back the screams coming from myself this time.  The dust clouds rise from the damaged churches finally collapsing in Winchester Street and the Timeball has completely disappeared.   Fortunately, the tunnel is continually opening and closing and I manage to get home through this eventually.\nWe fear another big one and my main hope is that I am not at the epicentre in Lyttelton when it comes.\n\nWe did apply for an emergency grant from Red Cross and received this some weeks later which was very welcome as our immediate expenses were great, paying our way when staying with other people, extra travelling and fuel costs to get the basics (our supermarket is still not open).",

        "text": "9th January 2012\n\nToday I was upset, almost feeling detached from reality when I rang EQC to discuss what I should do about further deterioration of the house in the recent quakes.  I was told they would give me a new claim number.  As it was read out CLM2012/……I was completely shocked, realising it was my third consecutive year of claim numbers for earthquakes.  How was EQC going to cope with yet another round of claims?  How was I going to cope with another period of dealing with EQC?\nAnd then the insurers telling me, look, I’m so sorry we have not moved forward on your settlement for the house yet.  But the truth is, firstly your claims manager is away until the 23rd and secondly our underwriters are telling us that according to their information, events have a high probability of occurring in February 2012 and as a result of this we are not looking to do a final decision on your house yet.  Sorry about this, we feel for you but that’s just how it is.\nI read Saturday 7th Perspective. “City’s Broken Heart Needs a Bypass,”  by Dunedin City Councillor, Lee Vanders, and while I do not, as a Cantabrian, warm to his idea of shifting the commercial heart of Christchurch to Dunedin where there is more solid ground, I do identify strongly with some of the statements he makes and it leaves me pondering again our futures here.\n“Earthquakes in other urban areas around the world have usually been one-off disasters.  Christchurch is an unusually on-going disaster, which has had unprecedented psychological effects on people living there.  The commonly described reaction during one of the many big quakes has been ‘terror’ but this is on-going, always anticipated, an epidemic of social shellshock terra infirma.  When children become skilled at accurately estimating the Richter scale number of yet another quake, don’t we owe it to them to bring them up somewhere more secure?”  I am still thinking about this statement and wondering what next for us.  This article and the editorial in yesterday’s Press, Monday 9th, gives the editors opinions of the outcomes of the recent get together and statements from the local seismologists.  This resonates with me and depresses me.\nI am talking today with a neighbour and friend and she explains how much she has enjoyed her recent 3 day break, not far away but far enough for her and her wider family to be less affected by the shaking.  \nAnother neighbour comes for a cup of tea.  She talks of having nowhere now to retreat to.  Usually home is the place she goes to feel safe, but she adds, “ but it’s not anymore, so where do you retreat to from here”?  She talks of how different people have different reactions and that she can understand that, but when people infer you should “just get on with it” or “get over it” she feels angry.  As she points out, the physiological reactions of the body are largely outside of our control.  When your body is exuding adrenaline endless times, you finally end up with adrenal exhaustion.\nJan, the artist friend, talks about the harbour she looks out on from Diamond Harbour.  She says of the harbour, “You are beautiful and duplicitous.”  We discuss the worrying trend which is to feel normal when it shakes and anxious when it does not.  The addiction to something so “not normal” is indeed disquieting.  I wonder how many people can identify with this.  Something I have noticed is my need to go back to the spot where I was when the big ones hit and to see and be with the people at that place again.  We have shared something huge and it feels right to see them again, strangers before and now no longer as we have these bonds created by these shared experiences.\nJanuary 11th 7.30am and the harbour is swathed in a soft mist.  We swim at full tide, 6 of us locals, in a flat sea.  It is delicious and we are glad to be here, alive, and here in Governors Bay.  Brief comments exchanged between two in the party about the nights shakes. “Yes, I woke, bit of a violent one I thought,” he says. I agree and realise I have had yet another early morning sleep disrupted.  We’ve had 4 over 3.6, I see, since 4.48am.\nBut that’s living with earthquakes.\nEarly in the New Year, on behalf of our Christchurch nervous public, quake experts were called together by our Mayor, to front up.  The main message that seemed to make impact was that the quakes around Canterbury, especially Christchurch, are likely to continue for decades, with the added proviso, but in decreasing numbers and magnitudes.  A more urgent message though was that a small tsunami event from any major quake offshore is possible, a new issue to worry about.  There was also the admission that the computer generated probability predictors have gone awry since the 23rd December.  Geonet’s forecasts issued on December 16th suggesting that during the whole of 2012 there would be up to 5 magnitude 5’s and a one in seven chance of a magnitude 6 happening in the whole of 2012, no longer have any credibility.  We have already had 8 quakes over 5 in magnitude and a 6 in the last 3 weeks, and we are only up to the middle of the first month of 2012, highlighting the fact that nobody really knows what is going on, including the scientists!\nWe are told there is another set of forecasts pending due, about the end of January. The writer comments that this next batch of forecasts could go askew just as quickly. We are tired of hearing statements like this. I am commenting on information from Press opinion \n\nMonday 9th January 2012.\nSo, armed with this new information and the continued shaking, what next?\n\n“On the positive side, we as a population are no longer complacent.  Our land and the buildings that remain standing have shown their resilience to repeated hits from nature.  We now know where it is safe to build and under what conditions and which areas are to be avoided.  Surely as this opinion writer suggests (Press Tuesday 10th January 2012) this makes Christchurch a safer bet than some other untested cities”.  Again, this is a comment I hear repeatedly; “Well, I would rather be in Christchurch than Wellington, or the West Coast.  We are now familiar with the “enemy” and they as yet are not.”\n\n2.00 am Saturday 21st January and I can’t sleep.  I woke just before the 4.1 at just after 1.00 am. Somehow, it felt like it was coming so I was not surprised, very noisy and from Rolleston.  A change from Pegasus Bay, back in the west again, and Lui is back on our bed.   The poor animals.\n22nd January 9.50pm.  \n\nWe are changed forever by the environment in which we live.  We are changed.  Our environment is hugely changed.  Our daily patterns and habits are changed.  Soon, we will hardly remember how it was before – the time before we worried about how close something was to the edge of a shelf or bench; the time before we checked visually a building before we entered into it; before we took clothes or dressing gown with us to the shower in case we had to get out fast, before the bedside table had a charged torch and cell phone at the ready.  We live with the very real threat of natural disaster.  We are grateful for the lulls when peace and calm prevail, like a gap from pain during a long illness, but we remain alert and conscious of the strong possibility of another round of disruption, over which we have no control.  We just try to get on with living our lives amongst it.\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

Two other girls were down the way, and started screaming as it began. We all held on the best we could, and I yelled to them to ask if they were OK. They looked at me, silently as it stopped, and we ran out of the bathroom to run up the stairs, where everyone from Cafe 101 was exiting the building. It took me about 4 or 5 minutes before I realised that I should ring my mum at home in the States, and also to find out if my flat was still standing (on High St, in the City). I was very very lucky. The people that I knew were fine, but my flat was not. I was now homeless, possession-less, and also without a University that I could work at. So me and my partner left to escape to Westport, to get some distance. It took several months to get my things out of High st, and it was quite a shock to see the state of the place (there was a possum living in my duvet, upstairs). But I found a new flat to be in, and I said goodbye to a lot of useless rubbish, because I had found a place that was ‘safe’ for now. Which is good enough, when you feel stranded. Thank goodness for that.",

        "text": "Its the stuff of nightmares and potentially could necessitate a life time of counselling to overcome.\nMy husband Brent and I were violently shaken awake at 4.35 on the morning of Saturday 4th September 2010. Our bedroom is upstairs and the movement of the room felt like it was going to collapse at any moment. Our biggest concern was our grandchildren who were staying overnight downstairs. We both rushed to get down the stairs to them, however the stairs were moving side to side and up and down. I thought it would be best to hold onto the banister but this too was wobbling side to side and not much use. On the way down the stairs the power went out. The night light at the bottom of the stairs was now not much use to us. I could hear Ally (2) crying. She sleeps at one end of my office and all the files on the shelves and the drawers in the filing cabinet were flying out into the room. I go into her room – a faceless stranger in a dark scary world – and snatch her up, bedding and all– no time to comfort her or explain what I was doing.\nBrent has gone to get Charlotte (4). She is hiding under her duvet hoping it will all go away. We rush the girls straight to our kitchen/dining room and shove them under the dining table before diving in under the table ourselves.\nThe main earthquake subsides but the earth continues to shake ferociously every few minutes with aftershocks. Between wiggles I retrieve our emergency box, which is kept in the bottom of the downstairs bathroom cupboard. What a relief to get out our torches and our wee battery run radio.\nBecause the power is out and there isn’t much in the way of moonlight, it is very dark looking outside. You feel very alone in the world as though there may not be anyone else left out there. Having the radio was so good as it told us we were not alone, where the earthquake had come from, what was happening out there in the community. Different people calling in to the radio station told their stories and updated us on what to expect next.\nIt seemed like a long time before daylight started to show itself. We spent the rest of the night under the table – just to be sure we are all safe and so we can all be together. The girls were great, not being upset at all. We pretended that we were “camping out, inside” with our torches and radio and duvets – all snuggled up.\nWhen it becomes light we see all the things that have fallen off bookshelves etc, quite a mess, watching where you walk for broken crockery and glass in places. \nOur cat is a bit of a burglar – she prefers to pinch her food out of the feed container in the bottom of the pantry rather than just eat it out of her dish, so we have had to put a kiddie lock – well make that a “cat lock” – on the pantry door at nights otherwise we will find her food container tipped over and spilt on the floor in the morning. In the morning light I see that the pantry doors are bulging with items that have fallen off the shelves during the night. I am grateful for the cat lock that kept it all inside until I could carefully deal with it in the light.",

        "text": "My story about February 22 2011.\nI work for an Oral Surgeon in Harley Chambers, Cambridge Tce and the day of the earthquake started like any other day.\nWe had our visiting Oral Medicine Specialist across from Melbourne who had yet to experience a sizeable quake.  His first patient of the day assured him we were in for another “big one” setting the scene just nicely.\nThe morning ticked along and we finished seeing our patients by 12.45pm, earlier than usual.  The other nurse, Claire, went off to Les Mills gym in her lunch break and I took myself to our staff room along the corridor and proceeded to make my sandwich.  The next thing I know the shaking started and increased in intensity and violence.  My first instinct was to run outside but the shaking was so hard it was impossible to move without being tossed to the floor. I managed to make it to the doorframe and held on until the initial shake stopped.  I don’t remember any noise but watched the walls of the old concrete building sway and ripple.  When the first shake ceased I began to move down the corridor but only made it to the next doorframe a couple of feet away before it started up again.  I could see the huge chandelier lights in the foyer swaying and have recollections of something falling but am unsure what.  When that shake stopped I really wanted to go outside but ran into our reception area to find Ajith who was holding onto the doorframe between the consultation room and the operating theatre.  He had a look on his face that I recognised well – shock.  I called out to him to come outside and we ran out of the building grabbing another nurse who was running from the opposite corridor quite hysterical.  Once outside we headed over the road to the riverbank.\nI remember looking across and seeing the Provincial Chambers reduced to a pile of rubble, cars came to a stop in the road and one man jumped out to ask if we were okay.  People were spilling out of buildings and police appeared out of nowhere and began to take control of the traffic.  The next aftershock came with as much force and we held onto the lamp post and watched the river start to rise and change colour to a dirty dusty light grey.  I said to Ajith that that had to be nearly a magnitude 8 and people had to have died.\nI looked up Durham Street and noticed my sister running down the road toward Harley Chambers and spotting me she ran over the road.  We hugged each other, happy to see each other alive and then she carried on intending to walk to Hoon Hay School to her children.\nI sent a txt to our daughter who was at swimming sports at QEll and she replied asking me to phone her.  I managed to get through and she had been dropped at Eastgate and was walking to her friend’s house off Ferry Road.  I had mistakenly assumed she was with her friend and would be safe at their house.\nI then sent a txt to my husband unsure of where he was, being mobile in his job and often up ladders in buildings.  He replied with a four letter word so I knew he was okay but none the wiser as to where he was.\nPeople were frantically trying to call or txt loved ones to check on them and I heard someone say it was 5km deep but at that time I still didn’t know that the epicenter was so close to our house.\nI was concerned about Claire and kept looking out for her and we moved over to the Worcester Street bridge.  What greeted us was the unforgettable sight of the Cathedral rubble lying across the square.  It seemed to tower over everything else in the square and stripped the Cathedral of its grandeur.\nI wanted my handbag so decided to go back into the building and Ajith asked that I retrieve his jacket from the staff room.  I raced in and out as fast as I could and we stood a bit longer on the riverbank.  It seemed hard to think about what to do and where to go.  I had driven our son’s car to work that day and parked in my boss’s car park in Amuri Court on the second floor.  Having seen the rubble in that direction, I was not going to attempt to go there and retrieve the car.\nI then made the decision to head home but needed to change out of my theatre shoes and get my cardigan.  I was at that point wearing Ajith’s jacket as I was shivering uncontrollably.  The building owner’s PA and I went back in as she wouldn’t allow anyone in unattended and we raced to the staff room to get what I needed.  It was difficult to get the door open, as many files had come down blocking the doorway.\nOnce outside again I checked on Ajith and said my goodbyes.\nLastly I received a txt back from our son, as he was to have caught a bus into town.  He asked that I phone and I managed to get hold of him as well.  He was still at home and describing the mess to me and what he had done.  I told him I was walking home and would see him soon.\nI crossed over the Worcester Street bridge to see a sea of people moving out of the square having been evacuated by the police.  I continued along Oxford Tce and saw the Hereford Street bridge, which had pushed up on itself.  Further along I noticed the gas burners still working outside a cafe on the Strip and then a man yelled to the policeman in front of me that the gas needed to be turned off.  The policeman then quickly asked that everyone move away from the area.  I began running behind him crossing over Cashel Street and not seeing the devastation there.  When I got to Lichfield Street, I asked the police on duty there if I could cross through the city to get to Heathcote.  He said no as there were people dead in there and told me to get a taxi or walk around the cordon.  I saw the gridlock of cars and said I needed to keep moving, so carried on.  A man asked another lad on his bike if he could have his bike to be able to go and check on his children.  The young lad said no and moved off.  I remember turning left up St Asaph Street but don’t recall crossing Tuam Street.\nI walked in an adrenaline filled daze along the road keeping away from the footpaths and building facades.  I saw one of our son’s friends in a car with his father and stopped to check on them.  I remember an ambulance coming along St Asaph the wrong way and thought how odd that was.  I kept taking my shoes off to move quicker as they were slippery wet, but had to keep putting them back on to avoid the glass.  I crossed over Colombo Street and was amazed at the amount of rubble and collapse across the road but didn’t notice the No.3 bus.  I saw the same at Manchester Street and remember noticing the scaffolding down across the road outside Beverley Studios along with the building.  I continued up past CPIT and noticed some of the Catholic Cathedral damage which didn’t look as bad as it really was from Ferry Road.  The liquefaction was quite bad along Ferry Road and I took my shoes off to wade through it bare foot.  As I passed the Shell petrol station, I could smell petrol leakage and moved quickly, fearful of an explosion.  I got to the Wilsons, Ferry, Moorhouse intersection and heard the distressed wailing from the Alpha Centre on the corner.  I stood there watching the staff trying to move the clients outside and considered going over to help, but I couldn’t move.  The desire to go home to my family was too strong.  Once I crossed over Wilsons Road I noticed my cousin sitting on the grass outside her workplace eating lunch.  I stopped to hug and talk and she was concerned about the whereabouts of her sister who works at McKenzie and Willis.  I assured her I saw the building still standing and said I would look out for her mother further up the road at Dowsons.  She offered to drive me to pick up Lana and then take us home but wanted to wait with her workmate who was waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up but he was stuck in traffic.  I didn’t want to sit still so said I would keep walking.  I turned up Dampier Street to pick up Lana and found her standing on the side of the road by herself.  Her friend hadn’t been home and she was very upset but pleased to see me.  We kept walking back up Ferry Road towards home.  She was soaked up her legs from wading through liquefaction and was in bare feet.  Once we crossed over Hargood Street I tried hitching a lift but no-one would stop.  We came across two cars outside ANZ in Woolston and stopped to ask them if they knew about the Ferry Road bridge.  They said it was closed to traffic but people were walking over it.  Not wanting to take the chance that that was no longer possible, I asked if they would give us a lift to the motorway roundabout.  They were happy to do that but cautioned us that their car was pink stickered.  I assured them I didn’t care at that point and didn’t think the police would either.  Once we were dropped off at the roundabout we crossed over the motorway bridge and dropped down to the tow path walkway.  We moved quickly along and noticed the fissures along the path.  \nThen another big aftershock hit and we had our legs spread apart and held onto each other in order to stay up.  When we neared the trees and pylons we ran until we cleared them, crossed over the Maori Village and over the soccer car park through our back gate.  It felt good to be home but what greeted us inside was a huge mess.  All our kitchen cupboards had opened and spilled their contents, as had the fridge.  Any food in there was now spread far and wide along the floor and up the opposing cupboard doors.  It was impossible to walk through the kitchen without wading through food and broken glass and crockery.  The laundry shelves had spilled their preserves and sent them crashing to the floor creating a sea of pickled onions, gherkins, apricots and relish.  We kept the dogs outside but they kept wanting to run away with the aftershocks, so we put them in the car.  Shortly after, my husband came home.  He had been in his van on the way to the Bush Inn shopping centre when the earthquake hit.  He said that all traffic came to halt.  Once the shaking stopped he continued on to find his workmate at the Bush Inn.  There was debris on the floor where they were working, but they finished their job and then headed home.  He had no idea of the scale of devastation until he began hearing radio reports.\nWe spent an hour or more clearing up the mess as best we could but seemed to make little headway.  With no power, water or sewerage, we settled in for the night.  The following day we continued cleaning for some hours carrying out so much mess.  We had what started off as a small geyser in the driveway, which then became a large mound of liquefaction by the next morning.  Our son tried taking some away in the wheelbarrow, but as it liquefied again it made for hard work so he built a small bridge to cross over it.\nOn the Saturday we had a visit from GNS to advise that there was a large rock above our house that could come down at any moment and we needed to go to the end of our section while they took it down.  About half an hour later they informed us we were about to be evacuated by the police.  We had 10 minutes to gather what we needed and find somewhere to stay.\nThe next four weeks were spent with friends not knowing if we could go home or not.   Geovert spent three of those four weeks working on the rocks on Bridle Path Road and gave us the impression we could return home when they had finished, but nothing was heard.  The communication with Civil Defence was scarce and it was difficult to find someone who could actually tell us what was going on.  \nOur friends were fantastic but had suffered a family loss of Owen Wright, killed trying to get home to Lyttelton over the Major Hornbrook track.  He had been taken out by a large rockfall loosened with the last major aftershock.  It was nice to be able to be there for them and help out where needed.\nIt is now 03 April and we are renting for up to three months until more major rock work is undertaken on Bridle Path Road before we will be allowed to return home.\nHarley Chambers is a no go for us, having suffered considerable damage of the lift shaft and further cracking of walls in our rooms.  Finally on 25 and 26 March we were able to evacuate out most of our gear and relocate to Normans Road, sharing another Specialist’s practice.  Much of our gear was strewn around the floors with our operating theatre having suffered the most.  Our theatre bed is on it’s side on the floor demonstrating to us the force of the shake as it is a very heavy bed.  We began our first week of work a few days later on 29 March and are still finding our feet.\nThe whole event has tipped our lives upside down in more ways than one, but it’s nice to feel a sense of purpose now with work to go to and the comfort of sharing experiences with others.  It serves to remind me of how lucky we have been despite our losses.\nThe aftershocks continue although not felt as hard at Spencerville where we are currently renting, and we begin the long wait to go home.\nSue Freeman",

        "text": "It was my 50th birthday, I was born on 22 February, 1961 and yet when the earthquake struck I was half a world away in Daytona Beach, Florida on business. Because of the time difference it was still February 21. \nThe first I heard of the quake was a text I received saying that there had been a big earthquake in Christchurch. Initially I didn’t think too much of it because I had been through the September 2010 quake and the numerous aftershocks. However once I started receiving more texts and then phone calls I knew it was bad. It was all over the news in the US, somewhat to my surprise as one often thinks that to Americans the only news is American news. \nMy home was, and still is in Sumner which got hit pretty hard but being half a world away it was difficult to grasp what had really happened back home. Feelings of helplessness, despair, anger and fear washed over me, my initial thought was I need to get back home now, but after speaking with family and friends back home they said there is nothing I can do, the damage has been done. Despite this I changed my return flights and managed to fly from Orlando to Los Angeles to Auckland and then on to Christchurch. It was the longest 24 hours of my life. \nWhen I finally arrived at Christchurch Airport I was greeted by my partner, Sharon, we both burst into tears, mine, at least was a combination of exhaustion and not knowing what had happened to my home and the city that I loved. Driving to Sumner though the now devastated streets was like something out of a holocaust or zombie movie, everything was dull and grey, almost lifeless and the further east we got the worse it became. \nAlthough I had been pre-warned I was still not prepared for the shock of seeing my beautiful home in ruins, gaping holes in the tile roof, huge cracks through the drive and courtyard, subsidence under the house and so on but that was nothing compared to going inside. Everything had been emptied out of cupboards and drawers, the contents on the pantry in a giant, sticky mess on the kitchen floor, the oven smashed on the floor, every glass, plate and other breakable smashed, tiles cracked and so on. The contents of the garage shelving emptied into a huge, jumbled pile but still that was nothing until I went downstairs to the bedrooms and my office. An inch of water greeted me as a result of the hot water cylinder bursting and flooding the house for three days non stop, I couldn’t even open my office door as every shelf and bookcase had shed its contents onto the floor, it looked like the scene out of one of those hoarding programs currently popular on television. \nThe feeling of helplessness and hopelessness was overwhelming, what to do, where to start, who to call and so on and so on. It was all like a nightmare except it wasn’t, it was way worse. Anyway the rest is history, as they say, it is now over 3 years on and I am still battling EQC, builders and the like, much as many of my fellow Cantabrians are.",

        "text": "4 September 2010 – 4:35am…\nI was woken from a deep sleep by the bed shaking violently.\n“Earthquake!?” I half say, half yell to myself in disbelief as I leap out of bed and try to stand in the ensuite doorway. My thought for the first few seconds is that Wellington is getting “The Big One” it has been promised for years and we are getting the edge of it. \nA couple of seconds later as I hear and feel the deafening rattle and shake of our house I realized it must be OUR BIG ONE!\nI looked across the room to my wife Nicki who is standing by the French door holding desperately to its frame.\nThe shaking just isn’t stopping the sound of things crashing to the floor echo though the house. I can’t believe the widows aren’t breaking.\nThe power and streetlights have gone out so we are in pitch blackness. \nAfter 40 seconds, which felt like 4 minutes, the shaking starts to slow down and finally stop.\nSilence!....except for a loud chiming coming down the hallway.  (What on earth is that?)\n“Are you ok??” I ask Nicki\n\n“I don’t know..” she says in shock.\n\nWe stumble around. \n\nWhere are the torches? Where are the camping lamps?\nWe make it to the kitchen to find Nicki aunts old carriage clock, which we never wind up, continuously chiming! “Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong ding dong!!” Nicki, shaking, opens the front glass of the clock to move the hands off the hour only to have the clock continue chiming but with the half hour chime! Clearly the vibrations from the quake have sent the clocks mechanism into overdrive! Eventually it stops plunging the house into complete silence.\nWe had to light a candle for light! Too bad if the gas was leaking! Finally find a torch we see broken ornaments all over the lounge floor. The CD and DVD stands have fallen over spreading their contents across the room.\nWe heard voices on the street, and cars driving off. Where are they going?\n\n“What do we do now?” Nicki asks.\n\n“Find a radio?” I suggest. Find one but no batteries!\nWe only now realise how cold it is and we’re shivering in just out night clothes.\nWe get back into bed, each with a headphone from Nickis MP3 in our ear tuned to Radio Live. We lay there shivering and in shock listening to callers calling in to tell their story and damage they have seen.\nWe cling tightly to each other with each aftershock we feel. Slowly the daylight starts to arrive. Nickis mobile started to ring. We spoke to her parents and mine to say we were shaken but ok.\nWe got up to survey the damage. Aside from the broken ornaments the house appeared largely intact. We rang our friends Jane and Ian. They were fine and still had power. They invited us over for breakfast.\nOn the way there we see fallen fences and chimneys. Parts of the church at Church Corner had crumbled, the supermarket is shut.\nOn arrival Nicki suggests we try and get hold of Aunty Audrey – alone in her house in Kaiapoi. We ring her with no answer. Fearing she has fallen we ring the retirement home across the road. The kind man there says he will pop across after doing his drug round!\nHe calls back to advise Audrey is in fine sprits sitting in her sun room with her neighbours. A great relief.\nWe got home to find the power back on. We spent the rest of that day watching the continuous TV coverage – not believing the damage to roads, buildings and houses, but comforted by the news there had been no deaths…",

        "text": "My son had crawled into bed with me as my kids often do, and we had relocated to the lounge because he’s a wiggly sleeper and I didn’t want to disturb my husband.  So it was that I found myself in the early morning hours of September 4th sitting bolt upright next to my still sleeping son and knowing that there was an earthquake.  It didn’t seem all that bad and for several seconds I thought about lying down again and sleeping through it.\nSuddenly the shaking intensified and without thinking I grabbed my son and ran for the doorway.  There was nothing conscious about my actions – purely by instinct I got in the doorway and wedged my son and myself in as well as I could while the floor rocked beneath us.  I could hear my husband stumbling down the hall towards us.  He had checked on our other two kids who were both still asleep and was coming to check on us.  Together we stood in the doorway listening to the house rattle.  I could hear what sounded like the entire contents of the kitchen crashing to the floor and I didn’t want to imagine what we’d see when it was all over.\nI don’t know how my husband got to us because when I tried to walk I fell over.  The floor was moving like waves on the sea and I couldn’t stay upright.  The shaking seemed to last for minutes before I could get out of the doorway and down to the other kids to make sure they were alright.  They were, blessedly, still asleep and neither of them remembers anything about it.  I can only thank goodness for that because that’s one less set of bad memories they have to deal with.  The son I had in my arms crawled back into bed in the lounge as soon as I put him down.  I guess none of them had ever really felt a quake before so none of them knew just how big a deal that one was.\nI don’t think I even really knew the enormity of what had happened.  I automatically pulled my computer out to check on the size of what had happened and what we were advised to do next.  It didn’t even occur to me that power would be down and it was disorientating not to have my normal avenues of communication.  At the time our phones were all cordless, we had no cellphones and our only radio ran off power.  We literally had no way to find out any information.  \nAs we were stumbling around trying to find and light candles a large aftershock rolled through.  I’d known, of course, that aftershocks existed but nothing prepared me for what they were really like.  My heart stopped for a moment and I looked over at my husband.  There was no discussion; we just knew were leaving the house.  We live close to the coast and with no way to get information and no way of knowing which direction the quake came from we wanted to be away in case of a tsunami.  We headed to my parents’ house (they were away overseas at the time) in the hope that they might either still have power or if not at least we knew they had a plug in phone we could borrow and bring home.  In the end they didn’t have power either and after checking their house was okay we came home again complete with battery radio and plug in phone.\nThe rest of the morning passed in a dream.  We called family and friends, listened to the radio and huddled under blankets on the couch in the cold early spring morning.  Power came back on at around 9am and we spent the rest of the day glued to the TV, open mouthed in horror at what was happening in the city.  The aftershocks rumbled through periodically, stunning me with how constant they are.  I remember thinking that if we had to live with that for days I was going to go a bit crazy.  I smile a little when I think how naive I was back then.  At least it was a good wake up call.  After that day we got together a much more comprehensive emergency kit than we already had and made sure we both have cellphones, both of which were sanity savers in February.",

Diary entries from April-early May 2011\nI did not expect to be writing again about an event which changed my life abruptly, but here I am, 8 months into a new journey, this time not an individual one, as it is shared simultaneously by a few hundred thousand people.  We all have our individual stories but there is within the zone a shared experience.  We have bad days and better days. We have sleepless nights and better nights.  Some of us are affected more than others. My husband lies sleeping beside me, completely relaxed and in a deep sleep.  My dog Lui has been disturbed again and lies between us at feet level in the bed, happy now and asleep again, ‘safe’ with the people he loves, but even he has had enough of being shaken.  And me, I sit writing by the light of the bedside lamp in the caravan where we sleep in the front paddock.  Ever since the first terrible seismic event on September 4th, 2010, our lives have been changed.  Our city, our family, our friends, all have been affected.\nBut lives are still being lived. I hear in the distance,  rare these days of roads so damaged,  a hoon car.  The wind is getting up in strength and I wonder how it will be here when real winter kicks in.  So far we have been lucky.  The earth began its huge heave way back in the early spring, eight months ago now.  We consoled ourselves through those early days with ‘at least we’re coming out of winter, heading towards warmth and summer,’ time to repair, to regroup, and to grow again in confidence.  And there were no deaths at first, but then of course that all changed.  Summer did come and with the warm, long days, the rhythms of life continued, the gardens grew their produce and the orchards their fruit.  It was a bumper blackberry season and citrus too, and feijoa’s and figs.  The sea was warm and the days settled. \nAround Christmas on Christmas night and Boxing Day, we were given a big wake up again.  A big jolt that was right under our city, and then a subsidence again on to late summer and early autumn, the harvest about to begin, Black Doris plums just ready and red skinned pears and Golden Queen peaches and the last of the strawberries and the first of the luscious black grapes.\nThat’s when it happened again and the earth threw us around so bad this time that the buildings were like flimsy tinsel.  Down they came, one after another, brick and mortar and wood and iron and steel and concrete and glass.  Down into twisted heaps.  This time, there were people under them.  This time there were deaths and injuries and what terror.  Water and mud and sewerage seeped up from under the ground.  The city and its inhabitants submitted to torture.  Some ran, and then returned, some ran and did not come back.  I wanted to run and not come back, but after running and resting elsewhere briefly, I did come back.\nAs a friend said today standing at the bottom of the garden path farewelling me following Easter lunch held here in the garden, “you need to stay on this land, your soul is here.”  Sure I’m thinking now, in the middle of the night, with the frightened dog twitching on the end of the bed in the caravan, my soul might be home on this land, but is this the rational thing to do, to stay in our unpredictable ‘war’ zone with the accompanying high anxiety.  But what choice do we have?  For most of us who call this place, Canterbury, our home, we have more than just an emotional attachment, we have financial constraints.  We have mortgages.  Many of us have homes and businesses damaged that need vigilance and nursing through this intensive care period to maintain what we own materially, or how do we start again?  We also need each other, and the only people who really understand are the other people who have gone through this trauma with us.\nPeople from outside say “you are heroic”.  Certainly there have been huge numbers of heroic deeds during this enormous crisis for our city and its inhabitants, but it is not heroism to stay here and carry on.  Rather the human drive and need to pull our homes into some sort of liveable shape again, and to carry on doing what needs to be done on a daily basis.  To be fed, to be working and earn again, and to try and reassure our young that they can be safe with us adults again, that is definitely the hardest bit.  How do you reassure the young ones when you have no answers, no surety from one second to the next?\nApril 27th 2011 Diary entry\n\nIt’s been a cold night in the caravan.  There was almost a frost this morning.  My fingers are cold writing this. Just made the early morning walk in dressing gown and boots and scarf across the paddock through the gap in the hedge, down the perennial border to the little house at the bottom of the garden to go to the “en suite”.  Quite a mission to get to the bathroom and one hopes fervently not to have to go during the night.  I think and feel for all the hundreds, even thousands of people in Christchurch eastern suburbs having to make their journey to a Portaloo, not through a beautiful autumnal garden as I have here, but rather to a broken suburban footpath, often still caked in packed mud and after rain, a black wet concrete like substance.  One neighbour of my sons has had a Portaloo now since September – 6 months.  It’s embedded in mud and on a distinct lean since the February quake.  The neighbour decorated it with Christmas lights to demonstrate its presence.  There is a feeling in the street now of hopelessness.  Sadness and anger have been replaced by this.  What can they do?  The street at surface level has had some flattening, some new tarseal, but underneath it is hollow and liquid with water wastes.  The smell has gone but the problem lurks and makes impossible the drainage of water from the households, so no baths, no laundry washing, certainly no toilet flushing.  And then carry on and have a normal life?  Go to work; send the kids to school, present well to the world.  It’s a challenge, and a challenge many in the eastern suburbs can no longer step up to. \nIn these areas you can never forget the events of the past months, not even if you were blind.  I walk using a walking stick and the uneven surfaces now cause me much misjudgement with my steps.  And with eyes open, the wonkiness of it all is at every turn, lamp posts one way, houses another and yet different to each other, neighbour to neighbour.  A front fence or wall outwards, another inwards, a house sunk to the left and another close by to the right.\nThey sit there sadly, no longer brave, many unable to shelter their dwellers, and others still acting as a winter shelter despite their angles and broken bits.  Post quake Christchurch dwellers no longer so fussy about their surroundings, settling for what will keep them housed warmly through the cold months ahead. \nCommon conversations, “how are you doing?”  “Oh well, we are getting there.  Are you back living in your house?” “Well, yes and no – staying there during the day.  Lots of cracks, plaster down, chimney down and the house has moved off its poles.  We’re on a bit of a lean but hey, we’re warm and dry.”\nOf course there are those who can answer differently- “well, actually we’ve been lucky, just a few ornaments down and a few cracks in the gib.  But hey, we’re okay.”\n\nSometimes these people express guilt or embarrassment that they have not been affected like their fellow Cantabrians, or their relatives and friends, and sometimes they just enjoy their good fortune.  At least there is somewhere nice and unbroken to go to as a neighbour, as a relative, it is not all complete devastation.  That’s one of the weird aspects of a natural disaster like this, the randomness, or seeming randomness of the assault on the surface dwellings.  I’m sure if you could see underneath from the perspective of the exterior of the earth’s crust you would see why the effects above ground are as they are, but we can’t do that, we can only feel and see.  We can gaze with awe on the outcome of the powerful thrusts and twists from below and we can have the ongoing experience of a land surface that feels fragile.  Even heavy vehicles passing by, now make our homes vibrate and move, no longer a stable earth, and the psychological effects for those being shaken or jolted on a daily basis takes its toll.\nMay 8th 2011\n\nAnd so it goes on. And the strangeness that is our new lives progresses. Some things stay the same – the seasonal changes.  Today we all raked leaves.  The leaves feel like drifts of snow, beautiful with their golden and red colours, making gorgeous patinas on the decks outside.  For a few moments it seems like none of the ‘new’ has happened and then my vision draws back and down and I see the walls around, all with their cracks and cavities, and the lean on the floor towards the front of the house draws my attention, a constant reminder of the changes wrought on the 22nd February. We are visited by another engineer on Friday, this time sent over by the insurance company. Hailed from Auckland, of Iranian descent, he looks around, alerted by the dangers.  One of his announcements remains on my mind.  “Your house,” he says wryly, “has split in two and one half is trying to leave the other half, sooner rather than later.  I would spend as little time as possible upstairs,” he says.  He leaves wishing us well as so many other assessors, consultants, and engineers have done before him.  “It’s not going to be easy, good luck.” “Will I see you again,” I call out. “Probably not,” he says.\nSome days our confidence returns and we breeze through the day with some normality, and then another big hit again, and we are vulnerable again.  Yesterday was like that for me.  We were enjoying a quiet cup of tea, me and my daughter in law in her new rental. One of the characteristics of post quake city is relocation, moving, change.  It is a very pleasant new space looking back towards the hills, the Cashmere hills in their autumn beauty, the grasses dry and golden, and the children playing in their bedroom, reading a pile of new library books.  A quake hits, it seems to grow, mouths go dry, and eyes enlarge as we are buffeted.  Then the children emerge, crawling from the bedroom.  One darts under the table and makes a turtle. She is crying piteously.  The other is silent and ashen faced.  I am sick to the core and taken right back again to those terrible seconds on the 22nd February.  My daughter in law shares with me a day later their saddest story about the four year old, mute with shock.  He has three songs, she tells me, he has made up, which he alternates performing, the earthquake one, the tornado one or the salami one (tsunami).\nHe is four years old and his world has been crammed with these experiences and images.  Today he says, as they begin to drive to preschool, “I’m going to sing a song about happy times.  Remember the happy times Mummy?  You know how we had one earthquake and then another earthquake, well, before that was happy times.”  There is no adequate \n\nresponse to make to this statement.\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

        "text": "I was in my office at Lincoln when the 6.3 struck on 22 Feb 2011. I initially thought it was just another aftershock but it soon became clear that it was indeed a nasty bit of work. \nWhen the shaking stopped I stepped into the corridor and others were commenting and saying things like “that was a decent one”. I decided to go for a wander to see if everyone was ok… someone yelled out that a building had collapsed in town and people were dead. My heart stopped and I rushed back to the office and grabbed my cell phone. This was worse than we had thought. We knew it was nasty but not this bad… I tried to contact my kids and despair set in when I realised the mobile network was flaky. Eventually we all found each other and I felt such relief. Sadness was still to come however when one of my daughters friends couldn’t locate her Mother. The thought that she could be lost in a pile of rubble was inconceivable, but eventually the horrible truth was revealed and it broke our hearts. My son lost a  friend too – he was killed in the Iconic Bar on Manchester St. Again our hearts were broken. The emotions ranged from disbelief to anger to heartache and then the depression set in. But, we’re fighting back and supporting those who need it the most. One thing for sure – life has changed.  We’re more cautious and always at the ready with candles, batteries, water and a fully stocked pantry and petrol tank. I haven’t slept through the night since Sept 2010 – has anyone?\nJune 13 2011 brought it all back again and December 23 was a Christmas gift we could very easily have forgone…. Now a year since the February 6.3 quake… it’s still so fresh in our minds, I still have to hold back the tears sometimes. The hardest thing is to keep going and working when there are days that you just don’t want to face anyone. Time is healing and things are slowly getting better –  There’s hope the frequency of these shakes reduces eventually. Scientists tell us they will – Mother Nature seems to have her own agenda. It’s been a roller coaster ride. The images of scared and shattered faces and falling buildings and the changing city skyline remind me that I am part of history in the making….  but I do miss the feeling that all is well in my world. However… colour is returning slowly – it’s not completely grey anymore… feelings of dread are fading and I have a lot to be thankful for. Putting things into perspective comes easy now…  we are learning to live again.",

        "text": "I was working in Radio Network House and lunchtime came along. I was going to get a bratwurst form my favourite stall in the square but on a whim I turned into the Raj Mahal and ordered take-away. There were two of us waiting there when the quake hit, slowly at first so we had enough time to look at each other, pausing to see if it was passing or not. It was not. The other person went for the door, the glass door. I didn’t think that was a good idea and collected him on my way into a solid corner. \nAll sorts of things rained down around us and at the lull, those in the restaurant part came through to find a way out. The window had popped and we all clambered out over the fallen masonry. \nI went straight to Latimer Square, a muster point for the company I was working for, and reported in. I was probably a strange sight, covered all over in dust and bits of debris. \nI was concerned then about my flat mate, a backpacker from Germany. I lived on Latimer Square and went to the apartment block but there were emergency services people already checking it and advising against entry. One of them on the premises checked my apartment but no one was there. My flat mate joined me in the square soon afterwards, after having dodged flying books to get out of the library. \nWell, we could not get in the apartment and I suggested a walk around the city, if we could, to try and find food and water. We walked south, managing the shifting pavement under our feet. We turned west, finding nothing for food or water. Heading north again we came to a fruit and veg shop and stocked up. Continuing on we found a service station on Bealey Av selling water from the forecourt. \nIt was nearly 5 hours later that we were back at the start, having witnessed devastation, liquefaction, shattered roads and bridges, trees down near the Botanical Gardens. Well, we still could not get into the building. It was now cordoned off. We looked at each other, with only what we stood up in. I said: “Do you want to get out of Christchurch?” “Yes,” she said, “but how?” \nAt that very moment I received a text on my phone. “Do you want to get out of Christchurch?” It was from a good friend. “Yes,” I sent back. “Where are you?” his message was short and to the point. “Dunedin, leaving now.” \nWe walked and hitched towards the airport, getting a little wet in the rain, the dusty debris turning a bit muddy. We were taken into reception by the Customs officers near the airport and given coffe and biscuits. They were very kind. \nMy friend from Dunedin, Andy Cooper, arrived and bundled us into his car. Then he turned around and drove back. When we arrived, he had accommodation set up for us at the farm where he was staying. It was amazing. \nWhile there, my work colleagues still in Christchurch had been able to get my laptop and camera out of Radio Network House. They very kindly got them to me in Dunedin. I owe them for that. \nWe finally got back into the apartment to get our stuff by Easter. Without all the help we had from other people it would have been very difficult and stressful. As it was, we were well looked after. \nMy flatmate, now in possession of her backpack, camera and personal gear, continued her New Zealand holiday. \nWe were very lucky to be uninjured and to have the help of so many people. That kind of help is hard to repay but we won’t forget. Our thoughts went out at the time to all those less fortunate than ourselves.",

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Lisa Bevan conducted shortly after the 22 February 2011 earthquake.\nMy name is Lisa Bevan and I am 46. \nI was downstairs under my house on Days Road in my workshop when the quake struck. I was just making a belt for some people and the earthquake started and I can’t really remember what happened. I know it got bigger and bigger and bigger and the next thing I knew I was standing by the side fence, holding onto it, I could feel the wood and breathing and panting and I saw all the clouds of dust coming up from Lyttelton and that was the most incredible site. All the cliffs from Quail island, the dust was rising from there and it was quite an apocalyptic thing because seeing all that dust I knew that some huge had happened, but it was all too quick to understand what had happened.  Then I raced down to the neighbours to see whether they were OK – she was already tidying up about 3 seconds after the earthquake, but her husband was the same as me – panting.\nThe next thought was Paul, my ex-husband coz we had this thing, we’d ring each other or come and see each other after aftershocks and earth quakes so I managed to get hold of him. I got into my car and went down towards his house and I got to by ‘Ground’ and the second aftershock happened and that’s when the side of Ground fell off,  just by where my car was, and I was completely encased in this cloud of dust, it was quite unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable, and this event is on Youtube.  I remember driving down and the road went like this (moving hands) and all the people and… it really was like a film. People walking around and the dust and the ground moving and the chaos… it still is very vivid for me, quite a surreal experience. So I just got past Ground when I saw Paul in his van come up to meet me, we saw each other and then we bumped into other friends that had escaped from the Coffee Company, they were walking around and were really disorientated and dazed. It seemed to be a real process of checking everybody “Are you Ok? Are you OK?’ and then… I can’t really remember what happened then. The initial bit is really vivid for me, but then… \nPaul came up to my house with me and we patched up the window and laid  everything down that was still up and then I packed a few clothes and went to stay with him. His house was a perfect sanctuary of cleanliness – it was quite unreal to be there. \nThen we went away for 10 days, maybe the next day. It was quite strange to be with my ex-husband, we formed this alliance and looked after each other.  And I felt really guilty for being away, coz it was on the news the whole time, and I just wanted to watch and watch and watch it.  And I was really aware that everybody would be here and doing stuff, but I actually couldn’t deal with it at the time, that wasn’t my time to do something then, it was for other people.  \nI wasn’t able to relax when we were away, I was still feeling caught up with it all, this huge thing that had happened, so even though I was away it was still very alive. Even though I wasn’t here I was still very involved internally.  We went to Oamaru to begin with and then to Wanaka, because we were working as well.\nIn Wanaka I had an amazing experience. I met some of the USAR team, they had the command centre there… it was an exhibition trailer lent by the owner. It was a pod lined with white board, so they write down the teams and the operations and the areas and what everybody was doing. And it was incredible to see it. So I was able to meet some of the USAR team, one of them had been to Lyttelton. I was amazingly moved by how they’d been, because he said that all the USAR people, when this earthquake happened had just got in their car, loaded up their own food, their own petrol, their own tents, and they’d just come. To me this was an amazing thing that people had come to help us\nI think the initial trauma was the hardest thing for me because this powerful, huge event had happened, it had happened to me and to everyone I knew and it happened to Christchurch New Zealand and it was a very powerful trauma. And I always felt growing up, being English, we don’t have things like this. And I know it’s probably the same for New Zealanders as well – they only have tiny ones, but the fact that I had shifted here… who knows that you would have a huge earthquake in your lifetime?  \nBut it also really made me stop and relax and listen to myself much more. I’ve stopped fighting myself. The huge thing of the earthquake has forced me to stop and has taken away my business, so it’s enabling me to look again. And I’ve been able to help some people and that has been a precious thing to help someone else.  All the people I have helped that has been an amazing experience, the connections with people. So many times I’ve said,’Oh, nothing matters any more’, and people always say to me ‘Oh, people matter.’ There is less stuff to worry about now, because it’s just the fundamentals that matter. Loads of things that would have worried me before don’t matter any more, what people might think or… I just cut through all that crap.  \nI have tried to notice how I felt. If I felt stressed or freaked or tired I have tried to listen to that since the earthquake. And that means that sometimes I have stayed in bed much longer than normally, I have started to look after myself more. I have been aware of wanting to help people and not getting to drained by that, and trying to reach out to people more rather than being insular.\nI think if I went somewhere else I would not have all the roots that I have grown. I think some people have run away and I am worried they carry the bad experience with them. \nThis is the place in New Zealand I feel most at home in. I call this my home now and I did not have that so much in my life, so it’s important for me to stay, and it feels natural to stay, even though they are knocking half of it down now, people are cold this winter maybe and people are facing difficulties, but it’s my home.\nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton.  We are very grateful to Bettina and the interviewees for allowing their interview transcripts to be posted on QuakeStories.",

Deafening silence, no birds, no movement. Then a call from a neighbour, “is everyone OK?” and people came out of their homes and met in the street. All my immediate neighbours were at home. It made it easier to have people around as the aftershocks continued and more boulders came down both sides of the valley. \nAs we all stood there, 2 cyclists screamed down our road, “The tide’s gone out!

But I think we are adapting to a new kind of normality. A lot of things have become normal here that never used to be. Read this and see what you think.\nA is for\n\nAftershocks. It is normal to feel aftershocks, in other words new earthquakes smaller than the big ones. There are thousands of these, according to the guys who measure their size (the “size-mologists”). Dozens of them are easily felt. An aftershock is certainly an earthquake. The earth moves! And a respectable earthquake doesn’t come alone.\nB is for\n\nBricks. It is normal to see piles of broken bricks and other rubble at or near people’s gates. It is not uncommon to see a huge pile spread across a whole section where a shop used to be.\nB is also for\n\nBarriers and Boulders and Bricks and Buildings and Bumps and Buttresses (see appendix)\nC is for\n\nChimneys. It is normal to see no chimneys on houses. Often you see the gap where the chimney used to be. Sometimes you see an oblong of plastic on the roof, or a pile of bricks on the ground, or a vertical strip of wall made of plywood. Sometimes one sees a brick thing projecting more than 10cm above a roof, and says: “Look, that house has a chimney!”\nC is also for \n\nChemical Toilets, Churches, CBD and Cracks\nD is for\n\nDust. It is normal to see dust. On dry windy days it blows about. On other days we mightn’t see it, but it’s still present in smaller quantities. We still breathe it in, it still collects on our windows, on our cars, even on the bookshelves which we have yet to restock with dusty books. It gets in our eyes.\nD is also for \n\nDoors and Ditches and Diggers.\nE is for\n\nEarth. It is normal to be very aware of the dynamic earth underneath us. It keeps reminding us that we are perching on the unstable skin of a hot molten planet.  What we call terra firma is not firm at all, and other common expressions are shown to be laughable, like “safe as houses” and “permanent materials”.\nF is for\n\nFootpaths. It is normal to see cracks and crinkles, not just in old footpaths. The pavement seems to be experimenting to see what it can do to make people stumble or trip.\nF is also for\n\nFloors.\nG is for\n\nGeonet. It is normal for people to consult a clever internet site that lists recent earthquakes. This has become a household word. We consult Geonet to see where the latest quake’s epicentre was, and especially to see whether we guessed correctly its Richter number.\nG is also for \n\nGeotech reports.\nH is for\n\nHoles. It is normal to see small holes in roads and footpaths, up to 50cm wide or deep. Wet weather encourages the growth of existing potholes and the propagation of new ones.\nH is also for\n\nHandbasins, Hard hats and Hollows.\nI is for\n\nIntersections. It is normal not to recognise these. It turns out that a shop with a high brick frontage was how we used to recognise the place, or a stone church… but what landmark is there now? Which intersection used to have that pile of rubble? None!\nI is also for\n\nInsurance assessors.\nJ is for\n\nJobs. It is normal to ask not “How’s you job going?” but “Where’s your job these days?” or “Do you still have a job?” or “What job are you doing now?”\nJ is also for\n\nJolts and Jiggles.\nK is for\n\nKitchen Stocking. Many people intend to do Kitchen Stocking, which actually means restocking – the replacement of crockery and glassware, and of fluids formerly kept in breakable containers (wines, sauces, cooking oils). Liquids love to go downwards, and they seize any opportunity given by seismic movement. \n\nBut most people are in no hurry to do Kitchen Stocking, and may even wait for the Christmas Stocking.\nL is for\n\nLiquefaction. It is normal to talk of liquefaction, a process few of us knew about, but which can pull the ground out from under a city’s feet. This has become a household word, and some people use it to mean the liquids produced from the process – in particular the silt that is suddenly ejected by a quake.\nL is also for\n\nLeaning hotels. \nM is for\n\nMud.  It is normal to encounter mud, not just after rain, but frequently and in big quantities.  Mud happens wherever exposed earth is affected by water (be it on hillsides, riverbanks or building-sites). Water need not come from above, or horizontally across the street, or from below.\nM is also for\n\nMess and Munted.\nN is for\n\nnew normal, now normal. It is normal to see big new signs starting with N: “No entry” signs, “No exit” signs. Also “New address” signs, and “Now located at…”. (Just occasionally one sees a sign saying “not munted”)  \nO is for\n\nOoze. It is normal to see signs of continuing ooze or seepage, in lawns and gardens, in footpaths and roads. The ooze is likely to smell unpleasant, whether or not it contains waste-water from cracked pipes.\nP is for\n\nPortaloos. It is normal to see these objects on the roadside every 200 metres or so. Despite their sometimes bright colours, they are now part of the everyday landscape.\nP is also for\n\nPictures, Pumps, Pipes above ground, pools, puddles, prefabs and plywood.\nQ is for\n\nQuakes. It is normal to talk about “quakes”, rather than “earthquakes”. Are there any other kinds of quake? None that deserve the name!\nR is for\n\nRoadcones. It is normal to see thousands of road-cones on any average trip. Sometimes they form orderly lines of 100-200, sometimes they stand in groups to guard a hazard, sometimes they lie down and obstruct the carriageway. In my own street one day I counted 246. And dozens of streets are comparable, which is why I call it normal.\nR is also for\n\nRoads, Riversides, and Rubble.\nS is for\n\nSilt. It is normal to see piles and pools of dirty gray silt, which people call liquefaction, and which is indeed the product of the sudden liquefaction process. In dry weather it turns to unpleasant dust.\nS is also for \n\nScaffolding, Supercranes, Shipping-containers, Seismologists and Staircasing.\nT is for\n\nTarpaulins. It is normal to see these on at least one roof in ten – guarding where the chimney used to be, or covering many square metres of unsound tiles.\nT is also for\n\nToilets, tanks, tents and trucks.\nU is for\n\nUncertainty.  It is normal to be coping with uncertainty.  Ours are not the universal uncertainties, however. We now say “I’m not really sure,” when asked: “When will your house be fixed?”, or “Will your house be fixed?” or “When will you have to move out?” or “How long will you have to move out for?” or “Will you be allowed to rebuild on that location?” These are uncertainties that eat away at people. “When will the sky fall down or the earth leap up and bite us?”\nU is also for\n\nUnderground and Uniforms.\nV is for\n\nVisibility Jackets. It is normal to see people wearing bright visibility jackets. Not just men, and not just working-class men. Some wear hard hats as well. And some are inspectors, or pretending to be.\nV is also for\n\nVoids.\nW is for\n\nWalls. It is normal to see walls that have lost bricks from the top, from the top half, or from top to bottom; or walls of brick or concrete blocks that are propped up with wooden buttresses.\nW is also for\n\nWindows, Workmen and Wheelbarrows.\nX is for\n\nXchange. It is normal to see buses lined up on two different avenues, which thus form the new Xchanges (hubs) of public transport.  This is due to the munting of the inner-city hub sometimes called the Bus Sex-Change.\nY is for\n\nYukkiness, yukky mess, yukky dust, yukky dirt, yukky silt, yukky ooze.\n\nYet now it is normal to resist describing anything as yukky. This is because mess and dust and dirt and silt and ooze have become normal… and because after two months we’re still not allowed to visit the CBD where there are flies and rats and mushrooms growing, and the perishables in the food-shops have yet to be properly dealt with after three months…imagine that!\nZ is for\n\nZones. It is normal to talk about the numbered zones in the inner city, particularly the Red Zone. This remains off-limits, even though it is the heart of the CBD.\nAPPENDIX\nBarriers. It is normal to see barrier fences around old buildings. These are metal ones nearly 2m high, or higher. And they’re built to last for years.\nBuildings. It is normal to assume that every building has been affected in some way by being seismically jumped. If one sees a lean, a fissure, or just a small crack, one’s first hypothesis is earthquake damage.\nButtresses. It is normal to see buttresses on brick or stone buildings or walls. The modest ones are simple wooden props, the ambitious ones (used especially for churches) are huge structures of steel. \nBoulders. It’s normal to see boulders on the bottom of cliffs, or boulders looking as if they might jump down to join their colleagues below. I even saw men on ropes halfway down a cliff dislodging boulders.\nBumps. It is normal on roads to encounter ‘speed-bumps’ even on arterial roads. They are not in predictable spots, and often there is no proper warning that your car is about to hit one.\nBusinesses. It is normal to check whether a business is still trading, and whether it is in its same premises or not. Phone calls and internet searches may be needed.\nChurches. It is normal for churches to have lost the apex of every end wall, or any side wall that rises to a high point of stone or brick. Earthquakes have a special dislike for neo-gothic.\nCones. See road-cones\nChemical Toilets.\nChurches. It is normal for churches to have lost the apex of every end wall, or any side wall that rises to a high point of stone or brick. Earthquakes have a special dislike for neo-gothic.\nCracks. It’s normal to see cracks in walls, in roads, in footpaths, on sportsfields, close to riverbanks.\nDitches and diggers. It is normal to see deliberately dug ditches. Along footpaths, across roads, along roads. It is normal to see the diggers digging more. The two kinds of diggers are mechanical and human. Some are even Australian.\nDoors. It is normal to encounter doors that open or close with difficulty, or refuse to do either, or have draughty gaps above or below. This can be observed even with new houses.\nFloors. It is normal to encounter floors that slope gently or suddenly downwards, or have bumps or hollows. This can be observed even in new houses – indeed new houses are the ones most affected by the cracking of concrete floor-slabs.\nGeotech reports. It is normal to mention these is a serious voice, as if they were exam results that will be released sometime to decide our fate. In a way they are.\nHandbasins. It is normal to doubt the quality of tap water. Can I drink this? Can I brush my teeth with this? Can I stand the chlorine taste?\nHard Hats. It is normal to observe this fashionable headwear, particularly on men.\nHollows. It is normal, even on smooth roads or footpaths, to encounter a few unexpected hollows. There is no warning, except when rain has turned them into puddles or pools.\nInsurance assessors. It is normal to look to these people for assistance, or at least for clarity in understanding our financial futures.\nJolt, jiggle. It is normal to feel a jolt every day or two (a quake measuring over 3.5)\n\nOr at least a jiggle (say 3 to 3.5).\nLeaning hotels. It is normal to see tall leaning hotels, even from several kilometres away. We are told the lean is very slight, but it’s easy to see.  The so-called “high-rise” buildings might be aptly called “heavy-fall buildings.”\nMess. It is normal to encounter mess, even in homes that have been lived in continuously. For example, books piled in confusion on or near people’s shelves, because they have obviously decided it’s a waste of time putting them back in proper order – at least not until the shelves are anchored.\nPictures. It is normal to see pictures hanging obviously crooked on people’s walls, because they have obviously decided it’s a waste of time straightening them.\nPumps. It is normal to see and hear large chugging water-pumps, on the footpath, or on traffic islands, even in the middle of the road. These are temporary installations to cope with liquids that are not being coped with properly.\nPipes above ground. It is normal to see pipes (water or even sewage pipes) running along a few footpaths, in place of the ones that are doubtless still there underground, munted.\nPlywood. It is normal to see big sheets of plywood tacked or screwed onto buildings, either to cover the broken windows or block the path of burglars. Or to replace the cladding of the house: my own place has over 20 m2 of plywood, six-ply sheets that ought to last a winter or two.\nPrefabs. It is normal to see ugly new buildings that have sprung up like silt. More than one stretch of green grass now resembles an army barracks. These prefabs are only meant to stay for 3-5 years.  Yeah right!\nPools/Puddles\nRoads. It is normal to negotiate stretches of shingle road in the city. These tend to get longer and not shorter over time. It is normal to encounter roadblocks or bottlenecks, even on streets one has used recently.  It is normal for two-lane roads to narrow unexpectedly into one lane.\nRiverside roads. It is normal to avoid these. Some are blocked in any case, and it seems that all suffer from lengthwise cracking where one side of the road has slumped towards the river.\nRubble. It is normal to see piles of rubble, usually including brick. By the road, in people’s gardens, beside the walls of shops and flats. Some of these rubble piles have got together and formed a hill in a nearby forest.\nScaffolding. It is normal to see scaffolding on buildings, especially near the city centre. There is a huge amount of it about, notably on churches and office blocks.  We cannot assume that these are being repaired: some are actually being carefully demolished, and others seem to be condemned to limbo.\nSupercranes. It is normal to see abnormal-sized cranes. Cranes to assist with tall blocks and churches have to be gigantic. They say these are the biggest in the country.\nShipping containers. It is normal to see these large objects lined up under a high building or a cliff, even if this means filling half the roadway.\nSeismologists. It is normal for people, even people who’d never even heard of seismologists, to look to these guys to help understand what’s happening underneath.\nStaircasing. It is normal to see staircasing in walls built of concrete blocks or of brick. This is where cracking forms not a straight line but a series of right-angled steps, vertical and horizontal, angling down like a staircase.\nToilets. It is normal to wonder “Should I use this toilet or not? Should I flush it? Will it overload the system? Will it fail to drain properly? ”\nToilet tanks. It is normal to see these wherever chemical toilets are or were in use.\nTents. It is normal to see big tents in carparks and sportsfields. It is normal for them to have people sitting inside watching television and computer screens. Yes, they have electrical wiring.\nTrucks. It is normal to see and hear large trucks, throughout the daylight hours, creating small tremors wherever they pass.\nUnderground. It is normal to think about what lies buried underground, particularly the pipes carrying fresh water and waste-water. We cannot ignore these things or take them for granted.  Besides, there are many teams of workmen digging at them, exposing them, and making efforts to repair or replace them.\nUniforms. It is normal to see men in uniform. Around the city centre they are often army uniforms, guarding the “red zone”. On one occasion we even saw an army tank (LUV) rumbling down our suburban street, in uniform!.\nVoids. It is normal to see – or rather not see – big gaps where buildings used to stand. The most striking voids are where tall buildings used to be, or where there had been two-storey corner shops.\nWindows. It is normal to see broken windows on deserted buildings, and boarded-up windows where glass used to be.\nWorkmen. It is normal to see many kinds of workman every day: sewage, electricity, roading workers. And they can be seen to be working!\nWheelbarrows. It is normal to see these beside people’s drives or garages. The fashionable colour is a sort of roughcast gray.",

        "text": "A blog entry written on Day 4 after the Feb Quake\n\nWe’re certainly not going to forget this quake – far more terrifying than the 7.1 last Sep 2010. Our city has just experienced the disaster scenario we thought we had escaped the first time – an aftershock during the lunch time rush hour that quickly escalated to our worst nightmare.   The CBD is in ruins with collapsed buildings. According to news reports, inside many of those buildings at least 108 people have lost their lives, with that figure still climbing. Over 200 people are still missing. It is just chaos. The roads are a mess, liquefaction has left streets resembling sandy, beach strips, with knee deep flooding in areas . So many more homes this time have suffered irreparable damage and most likely will be condemned. We are in disbelief that this has happened to us again, but this time with much more extensive damage and many lives lost. The scenes on the news are tragic – we’re only just seeing them now after days with no power and no t.v.  Until now we could only imagine what we were hearing on the radio.  Now the t.v images are leaving us in shock all over again.\nIt is now day 4 after the quake but I think we are all still feeling numb and strange and just wondering.  Do we stay? Move? Go up to see family and friends for time away? When will schools reopen again? Am I in any state to go back to work? Will my husband be able to go back to work with his building in the CBD? What income do we live on in the meantime?  My mind is just a jumble of so many questions without answers…\nI don’t have a miraculous survival story, not even one that is remotely interesting. But for memories sake it needs detailing. I was at home, in the kitchen, when it hit.  That all too familiar rumbling escalating quickly into a loud roar, then being accompanied by violent shaking – side to side and up and down.  I had just finished cooking cupcakes for my 6 year old’s birthday. When the quake hit, my immediate thought was that it was just another customary aftershock like the hundreds we have already experienced from the 7.1. But as I was thrown and struggled to remain upright, I immediately realised this was major and this meant people were going to die, maybe even me.  Holding that thought, I found myself under the archway in the kitchen, being pushed backwards by the force. From that spot I was able to grab a tight hold onto the pole that holds up our kitchen cupboards above the bench. There I clung while I saw the contents of cupboards being thrown out and watched in stunned, disbelief as the heavy fridge slid out from its wall cavity besides me. I could hardly stand, but I sure focused on doing just that.\nWhen the movement ceased, a quick scan of the room showed that almost everything sitting on top of something was now down on the ground. I was shaking so bad that when I grabbed my cell I could hardly hold it still, to txt my husband.  So I abandoned the idea and ran out of the house on shaky legs, straight down to school.   I just had to get to the children. I must have been one of the first parents down there and it sure helps when you just live around the corner! I just remember that eerie silence on the streets, you know something terrible has just happened.  A few others walking past had looks on their faces that I’m sure mirrored my own.  By the time I got to school, it was pandemonium out the back field, with children upset and crying. But they were all making their way to their classroom teachers. What a relief to see my 10 year old and 6 year old who were together with their cousin comforting each other.  I will never forget those pale, shocked, tear-stained faces – the kind that are meant to belong to people on the news, or in movies – not on my own children.  These kinds of things aren’t meant to happen to us.  It was my moment of self pity but through it came a quiet, hopeful voice asking “so we are still having my birthday party at Chipmunks aye mum?”.   It was the voice of my 6 year old.  Surely his birthday was still going ahead – what could be more important to a child? Poor boy, so sorry to disappoint him!  But he was somewhat placated with the fact that not every child gets a big earthquake on their birthday!  \nI  soon found out that my children were in the library together when the quake struck. Ceiling panels, shelving, books and furniture had fallen down around them and my daughter related how she saw the fish tank shatter spraying shards of glass and injuring a girl’s leg.  She had grabbed onto her brother and dropped down together into “turtles”, but then followed urgent instructions from the teacher to evacuate the building. I’m so grateful big sister and little brother were together during the ordeal.\nAt school I continued to wait with the children, during which we experienced more sizeable aftershocks, sending already fragile children and adults into panic again – more tears, cuddles, reassuring.   \nSome time later, I was able to go and get my 4 year old from preschool. He seemed unperturbed about what had just happened, in fact for him, it had turned an everyday turn on the swing into the ride of his life!  He told me “There was lots and lots of swinging and I went all around”.  \nIt was at preschool that I received a reassuring phone call from my husband letting me know he was safe and trying to get out of the CBD.  It didn’t strike me until later how lucky my husband was inside his 100 year old work building on Cambridge Terrace.  Also equally lucky to have retrieved his car only half an hour prior to the quake, from the farmers car park building, for no particular reason either.  He parked his car right outside his building and returned upstairs to his office, to tackle the paperwork again when the quake struck.  Now he had joined the mass of cars stuck in gridlocked roads and was witnessing sad, broken scenes along the way.   A usually, uneventful, everyday 15 minute drive became a 4 hour crawl along creviced, flooded and pot-holed roads.  \nOur family was so very fortunate.  We were able to reunite, give each other hugs and cuddles and know we were all safe.\nOthers weren’t so fortunate.  Our hearts and prayers go out to them.  What a devastatingly hard and long road they face.",

We have three children, the eldest was dairy farming ten minutes away by car and living with her employers at the time, the middle child was staying with friends in Ashburton and the youngest was asleep in the sleepout attached to the garage.  \nThe first sign of something being wrong was the noise…  I was in an extremely deep sleep and I think the noise had been going on a while, I felt my husband stir beside me and we asked each other what was going on at the same time?  At that time the bed began shaking, we looked at each other and both said earthquake at the same time.  We jumped out of bed and stood in the door frame of our bedroom.  The shaking started off quite gently but by the time we had reached the door it was very intense.    We were both holding on to a side of the door frame each, the rooms were undulating sideways and backwards and forwards I don’t think we would have been able to stand if we weren’t holding onto the door frame.  \nThe noise got progressively louder and the rocking got worse, I could hear the wall units banging against the walls and the house was making the most amazing creaking sounds.  The noise eventually became less but the house was still creaking and the floor was still undulating, it just seemed to go on for ever.  The amazing thing was only 3 things fell over, a fly spray container, a picture frame next to the flyspray container on a wall unit in the hallway and a little ornament on the wall unit in the lounge.

The noise and movement was so violent that, for the first time, I thought I need to get to a doorway for safety. I got off the bed but couldn’t walk I tried to crawl but could not do that either. After the shaking stopped I went out on to our deck and called out to see if our neighbour were alright. We live in a closely built community of houses. They were fine but shaken. I then tried to get out of the house but all the doors had jammed. I called out to neighbours who helped open a door so I could get out. My wife was out on an errand and I was concerned that she would be allright. She was but it was an hour before I knew this. A young man in shorts who had been working on the road was running down our street calling to every home to see if anyone needed assistance. A neighbour down the road was wandering around dazed and distraught because his wife, who had only got her licence the day before, was out driving. I spent a short time with him, made him sweet coffee and tried to settle him. Our immediate neighbour, a young Irish woman, who lost everything in the September earthquake was wondering down our shared driveway in a disturbed state. She couldn’t contact her husband, a doctor at Burwood Hospital. I bought her home made her a sweet drink and talked to her until her husband arrived home after about an hour. With no electricity we did not know what was happening. But we knew it would  bad. We live close to the city centre and there was a lot of dust, lots of people walking who told us of terrible damage in the city center. The roads were clogged with cars that were abandoned everywhere.  I was unable to settle so decided to tidy up our study and kitcken, both of which were in a terrible mess . I finished this put the saucepan on the gas hob for a cup of tea when an aftershock created another mess. The radio gave us good information but we felt very disconnected for our city not knowing what had hasppened. We later found from our children, who all live in other centres, that people outside of Christchurch had a far better understanding of our situation than we did. Also there was a sense of dispair that this had happened to us again. We could not get out of our street as the road was so damaged. A 100 meters from us lateral displacement (we live next to the Avon river) created a hole into which 4 cars could fit lengthwise with all them below ground level. A neighbour had a well from which we got water until we had our supply restored 2 weeks later. Electricity was restored after about 8 days. My wife’s sister, husband, 2 teenage girls and large dog lived with us for about 8 weeks as their home and rest home were both destroyed. For a week the four families of our close neighbours shared an evening meal and supported each other. This was wonderful time and greatly helped. Ten months on we still live in our home which is damaged but repairable and await a decision on our land. Our zoning is still orange. This is unsettling but we are determined not to fret about it and eventually we will do what needs to be done. It is daunting to enjoy  a full and ordered life and to think we may have to start again. We love christchurch and will definitely stay here. I visited the central city recently and found it distressing. Life has reestablished itself by living in a city that has no center. I have to find new suppliers for all those mundane things we buy – car tyres, the hairdresser, computer cartridges, coffee supplies and the like. In many cases they have either disappeared or relocated. So much has gone. I still cannot read of or see the results of the earthquake without feeling  quite sad and frequently feel quite tearful. But I am optimistic about our fine city and its people.",

Leaving our lunch spot I left my friends and made my way to our school hall. About 5 minutes after everyone arrived we were doing warm up scales \n12:51 Screaming children surround me I am a boat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in a thunder storm, no one can stop, start or change anything Mother Nature is doing as she pleases, we dive for shelter the 3 people including our teacher – Mrs Vicki Lewis go for the doorway, the rest of us, about 6 somehow get under the school piano.\nWe leave the building quickly, people still on the ground in the “turtle position” luckily far away from the Lyttelton Goal wall. When we get all the students out of the buildings and all together we move to the bottom part of the school to be safe and to comfort each other, after we had been given a breif of what was going to happen, we make a move of getting everyone to the safety of the Lyttelton Recreation Centre, well on that perticular devistating day, the Civil Defence Ward.\nAll of a sudden I see my Grandfather coming along the road in his bright yellow truck, on a normal day this would be humiliation for me, but for once I didnt give a damn.\nI open the front door to our house, it was devistation at school but I soon realised that was nothing to what I was about to see. I walk into the lounge my Grandmothers china cabinet (a life-times worth of collections) is on the floor and everything is on the floor, our plates, my fish tank absolutely everything is gone, I am crying my eyes out, trying to see through my tears I force myself to venture around the rest of the house. My room a shambles the bathroom is a mess. About 60% of the windows around our house are smashed. I was living in our caravan for about 5 and a half months with my grandparents and our dog, cat and for a little bit a cockatoo as well. 2 days later it is red stickered. I somehow also managed to practice my alto saxophone through all of our personal devistation. As I sit here at this current time I have been sitting at my desk in our new but damaged rental property only about a couple of blocks up from our severly damaged home. I am 12 years old, in my Cashmere High School loving it and making friends and looking forward to my future, Earthquakes or not, Lyttelton and the whole of Christchurch. We will be back, we have to remember we have lost our history, but the way we lost our history will be part of our futures history.",

Almost frozen to the bed your mind struggles to comprehend, then it comes to you “Quake”.  Your thoughts are slow to come then a decision is reached, this house is new (only four months since we moved in) it should be okay nothing too heavy to fall on you from above just to stay in bed until the shaking stops. You hear things falling, a tall boy crashes down, things fall off the bedside table. Down the hall you can hear crashing in the kitchen, there goes the fish tank. It is so dark, just waiting for the shaking to stop, this is big the shaking goes on for sometime. At last it stops, my husband gets out of bed and finds a torch, checking out what has fallen. I quickly get dressed and head for the lounge. Damage is not too bad just broken items from the pantry, start to try and rescue the tropical fish from the floor. Riff Raff the cat wanders in checking out the mess on the floor he doesn’t seem bothered at all, his sister Rascal is not to be seen (later it is determined she will spend the whole day up in the ceiling of the garage).  These cats are young just 6 months old at least they didn’t take off.  Just then the neighbours turn up to make sure we are okay.  My cell phone rings, it is work, I am needed.\nI have to leave my husband cleaning up the mess. I know he has family members nearby to see. I drive around a couple of streets to pick up a work colleague, a stranger stops me to ask where the shake originated and how big, information is coming in slowly over the car radio and I am able to tell him it was centered not far from here and about 7. Driving into the city from Rolleston was surreal. I took the back roads, came across 2 dogs in the middle of the road confused, there was the odd person out and about but not many. Once in town I drove over bridges not giving it a second thought, through the centre of town, down Colombo passed the cathedral to the Crowne Plaza Hotel where I worked. There was quite a bit of damage I saw on my way, but it really was only snippets.  In a way you felt you were in a cocoon only observing the little bits of what you could see around you, the enormity of what had happened was yet to be realised.  Little did I know then what was to come months later. The rest of the day was focused on the Hotel, guests and staff.\nMany of us worked tirelessly over the following days and weeks to get the Hotel functioning back to where it was pre September 4th 2010 as best we could. \nFinally I got home that day about 5.00pm and catch up with what has been happening throughout the day there.",

Then I thought “it’s bigger than usual” and voiced it accordingly. The whole gallery seemed to be on an angle. \nTwo women near me staggered to a doorway and I followed somewhat like a sheep. After it was over, I was hoping to finish looking through the gallery but the inevitable announcement came: leave the building. I realised the meaning of the word surreal.\nWhen I got outside, the first thing I noticed was the dust. I thought the Arts Centre doesn’t look too good. The 5.7 aftershock struck as I was walking past the building north of Cheese Mongers. The top looked like it would fall but it didn’t. I walked into The Square with stunned people walking in the opposite direction. To my horror, I saw the Cathedral down. I then walked along High Street to see whether anyone needed help, I saw people giving CPR to someone. That was when I realised we hadn’t dodged a bullet; there were casualties. On another street, a car was covered in bricks with the horn continuously tooting. In a surreal way, I assumed no-one was in there; no doubt I was wrong.\nAs I walked past the CTV building, I couldn’t remember what was there. There were rescue workers everywhere so I knew I would be more of a hindrance than help so I kept walking. I saw a woman being escorted away, she had a look of terror on her face and was uncontrollably screaming.\nI walked back through The Square, past the Arts Centre and Dux De Lux, past the Museum, to Hagley Park. A large branch had broken off a poplar exposing a wild beehive. The bees were staying close in rather than buzzing everywhere and stinging people as would normally happen. They were obviously as stunned as the rest of us.\nAfter that, I walked through Hagley Park talking to complete strangers. No buses were running so I had to walk home to Papanui.",

        "text": "February 22 2011 started out as a cloudy, unusually cool day. My fiancée and I headed to university in heavy traffic. The day seemed fairly ordinary; we went to work in our respective departments. At lunchtime the weather had cleared to the extent that I decided to take a short walk around campus. I was walking alongside the Avon River, adjacent to the Student Association building, when I felt the ground jump under my feet. I paused. The footpath suddenly shook violently. Cars on University Drive rocked back and forward. Everything was being wrenched and thrown around by this new quake. The shaking went on for approximately 15 seconds. When it finished I uttered something like “good thing we were outside for that!” to the other pedestrians who were nearby. I then quickly sent a bulk text to my fiancée and friends who I knew were either on campus or in town. I jogged over to my department, knowing that we would be evacuated, at least for a time. I met up with colleagues who had been inside; they told me the shaking felt worse than in September. This was not a good sign. \nIn truth, it took some time for us to realise just how bad things were. I reasoned that we might have experienced a magnitude 5 event; or perhaps the quake had been centred right under the university? Being that no buildings had collapsed on campus, and no one was obviously injured, it was initially difficult to know the full extent of what had happened. As we stood in the carpark a significant aftershock occurred; like the event at 12.51, this quake had a great deal of vertical acceleration. I could feel the ground drop and watched and the buildings around us swayed significantly. This day was indeed different to September…\nI eventually found my fiancée and some of her colleagues on the other side of campus. On the way there I happened to spot Dr Mark Quigley, the University of Canterbury geologist who had attained national prominence following the September quake. I asked Dr. Quigley about the size of the quake we had just experienced; he told me Geonet were reporting it as a 6.3 centred in the Heathcote Valley. Surprised by the size and location of the quake, I asked whether it could still be classed as an aftershock. He speculated (rightly, it would turn out) that the quake was probably triggered by events in September. \nThe scale of what had occurred that dreadful afternoon was soon made apparent to me by the number of aircraft now flying over the city. I have never seen so many helicopters in the sky at once outside of an air show. The Westpac Rescue Helicopter was stretched to capacity; Garden City Helicopters and others were helping to ferry badly injured people to any hospitals they could. I now understood that many people had died and hundreds more were injured. Reinforcing the scale of the disaster, an Air force Orion and Hercules carrying army personnel and supplies flew over us, en route to the airport. Disasters of this nature were previously seen only on the news or in films; to be in the middle of it all was surreal.",

There was a cool wind and a few spots of rain.  \nI had been looking forward to that day because it was to be the Hillmorton High School Swimming Sports  -a day of colour and competition and noise in the sunshine. But it was not to be. Over breakfast, I listened to the radio, which announced the Swimming Sports was cancelled, except for serious swimmers, who could race at Halswell Pool in the rain.\nI wasn’t really a serious swimmer, but I thought I’d have a go. Some builder was plastering the ceiling as I left -the final repairs from the September earthquakes. I biked to Halswell Pool and worried about how cold the air temperature was. There was only one other year nine there,  a guy called Chris, who I knew to be a better swimmer than me. He bet me in every single race that morning, but not by much. \nSo when I dived into the pool at 12:51, I was feeling tired and frustrated, but I thought ‘this might be the one where I beat Chris’. I was in the far outside lane, and as I glided through the water, I saw the centre line of the lane wobble like a snake. I dismissed it.  The waves were huge, so swimming forward was really very difficult. I managed to do two lengths before a wave crashed over me, knocking my breath away. I stood up, putting my feet on the bottom and my head out of the water. People were screaming, not to cheer the swimmers on, but in terror as the ground shook. The waves were vast, and people, like me, had stopped swimming and seeing what was going on.\nWe got out of there pretty quickly. The changing rooms didn’t look too safe, but risked it to get into some dry clothes. Our principal had been buying us hot chips when the earthquake struck, so we crammed them down and piled in cars, back to school. \nThe rest of the afternoon was spent sitting on the school field, watching the liquefaction spew out of the ground. I had Dad’s mobile, so there was no way to know where or how he was, and Mum had been in Timaru and hadn’t felt it. At about 5pm, Dad and my brother arrived, and we went home together. An hour later, Mum walked in the door: we were all together and safe.\nI never did beat Chris…",

We weren’t too busy, with 4 tourists awaiting their ‘Sheppards’ Pies, I had removed 2 from the oven and was bent over with my mitted hands on the other 2 when the quake hit (Feb22). I rocked and took a second to think, just let them go.  I pushed the 2 dishes into the oven turned passing the deep fryer, (not giving it a thought, that it only stands on 4 flimsy legs) got to the first doorway, (with the full deep fryer now 4 feet behind me) stood in the doorway, watching 3 upright freezers rocking towards me, and each time I thought they’d drop, they rocked back again.  I was told later it lasted 20 seconds, at the time I had no idea.  It stopped and as I had many times before in the course of much lesser shocks, my sense of humour kicked in and  I called out ‘Lunch is off!’  I heard the barmen instructing my tourists to leave the restaurant, and reminded myself, this might be serious.  I proceeded into the bar lounge and instructed some very shocked patrons, they had to get out.\n Out on Amagh St, people wandering around, the tram tracks bursting up from the road, people standing staring towards central city.  Our tourists looking very worried, I retrieved our smoking chairs from the front of the building, and found a place on the road to put them and encouraged the women to sit down.  In the end, telling them they must head back to where they were staying.  Liquifaction was beginning to come up through the pavements, running along the gutters .  \nI decided there was nothing more to be gained by hanging around on the street, so informed the rest of the staff, I was going back in to get my car keys and leave through the back entrance to get my car and head home, little did I know this was going to take many hours and with my gas tank on E for enough, tricky. We all went back in, locked up as best warped doors would allow and departed,  I ended up with one other non driver. \nWe left turning left into Gloucester St, then a right into the one way system hoping to head for the hills to Lyttelton, but the Police were directing us to turn right again, then right again, now we are heading past the gallery around the park and towards Bealey Avenue, stopping often rocking often and going no more then 10 km an hour.  Hours later we get down Bealey Ave all the time wondering how long our petrol will last, and just how popular we will be if we have to get pushed off the road.  At the end of Bealey we are hoping to turn right, no, straight ahead, no, left we went.  Then made a rash decision to go right, through a suburb I didn’t know, and actually ended up going Avonside drive and down Linwood Ave, 4 and a 1/2 hours later, made it to Mitre 10 in Ferrymead to find out the bridge was shut, managed to get down Garlands Rd, where a very nice lady in a local business there, who had no water,  let us finally go to the toilet.  I think someone informed us the tunnel was shut, and we were out of gas, so managed to get to a friends in Grange St.  \nI finally heard from most of my family at dinner time, and very late that night my youngest son used his navigator to come and get me by going over Dyers Pass through Governors Bay.  Unfortunately we did not go the same route back leaving Grange St, and turned left at the river, and were blinded by a stationary van that had done what we were about to do and run into some split road, with dead ends, so our driver side tyres were stuck.  Some lovely helpful 4 wheel vehicle drivers came down one after the other, and towed us out with the 2nd towing the van out, and we were back in Lyttelton by 10pm.  One of the Ambulance Officers where we were at the station needed a lift home to Diamond Harbour, so as the only volunteer, I drove him home with two of my sons in the back seat.  I was to find out the next day, not many people would drive on that road, in daylight!  The next day we also went around for another reason and took pictures of the house with the hole in it at Rapaki, all the more reason seen why not to drive around the bays.  \nThe first night my son had informed me on the phone before I got back that our home was munted, I remember saying ‘yeah right Ben’  No mum, he repeated, it’s really munted.  It turned out when the quake struck he had been in the kitchen about to step into the walk in pantry to get to the fridge,  the contents of the pantry came up to his knees, and the kitchen floor was covered in broken glass, so he had to jump the bench.  He went to the top of the stairs to yell for his older brother, who was asleep.  His brother stirred and thought, bit of an earth quake, the 2nd time he heard his brother, he decided it might be serious, raised his head to find his tv and bookcase on the bed beside him.  When he got up the stairs the two managed to find one door out of 5 that would open, they left walked across the courtyard, up the steps to the road, where upon they heard a loud ‘crack’ looked up and saw the face of the cliff way above break off, and rocks cascading down the valleys either side of them, ploughing through trees.  One large rock the size of a car bonnet landed right inside the subdivision gates and the other rolled through a retainer wall across the roadway within the subdivision and came within feet of a ladies property who lives on the road leading up to the subdivision.  Shortly after that their father and other brother got up the hill to pick them up.  \nWe were lucky enough after spending the night in the Lyttelton St John Ambulance station, to be loaned a key to ‘Grubb Cottage’ by members of the committee that took care of it, and so we had a roof over our heads and a floor to sleep on.  Less than two weeks later a bureaucrat from Ch Ch City Council came with her clip board, and told us we had to get out.  That they weren’t insured to have anyone stay in it.  So we frantically got hold of our insurance company who told us what our insurance would cover. \nDuring the 2 weeks following the  quake, all was very surreal,  just surviving seemed unreal.  While my husband coordinated between the Ambulance service in Lyttelton and the Fire Brigade, I co- ordinated  with the Navy the retrieval of the contents of our local supermarket, having it stored in the training room at the St John rooms.  I saw that if the Cinema across the road collapsed, Lyttelton was going to loose its only food source, with the Sumner Road closed and the tunnel closed, if Dyers Road ended up closed due to a subsequent quake we were on our own.  \nI cannot say enough about the help recieved from ‘The Navy’ they were the best.  \n\nI would wake, early in the morning at Grubb Cottage, have to don my dressing gown, walk along to the Ambulance station to use the toilet, then I’d walk along to the Navy squad minding the cordon of our main street, check what hot drinks they would like and walk back to the Station and return with steaming cups, I got to know some great folk.  We had no running water for over a week, and I even managed a lovely hot shower aboard ship. They fed our town, and did some amazing work while they were here, and I hope someday to catch up with some of them and remember. \nWe finally found a rental, and even though we had to vacate it the following December, we took it.  This week we begin our vacate, the owners will return for 5 weeks Christmas holidays, we must be out by Christmas day, and will be returning early Feb.  This year has been an emotional roll-a-coaster, the emotions the same as after a death. Five adults living together, all adjusting to their new circumstances.  My family are all well, my 3 sons, daughter, SIL and grandson are all well.  For that I feel truly blessed.",

Everyone has a story of where they were & what happened at 12-51pm 22 February 2011.  Here’s mine….\nIt was a typically busy day at work & I had several jobs to attend to around the City. One of my last jobs for the morning was at Price Waterhouse Cooper building level 19, just a little after midday. Their reception windows look north across the city & the glass is floor to ceiling. My knees always weaken when I stand close & look out across the Avon River, PGG Wrightson building & others. Concluding my business, I felt the hair prickle on my spine recalling the quake Sept 4th & thought how I’d hate to be up here if another struck.\nI went home for a poached egg about 12-30, fed the fish, then rushed back to work for a 1-00 meeting. As I pulled out of our street & then on to Centaurus Road by the Heathcote River,  the steering wheel pulled hard to one side & I could clearly see the road rising & falling in a wave motion, perhaps 500mm high. I braked gently. At this same time, the concrete guttering either side of me appeared to explode upwards sending a white powder & pieces of stone high into the air as if stuck by a mortar shell. The sound of this & the quake was not unlike a jet engine at take off. Seconds later, the Heathcote River sent up a 4 to 5 meter wave that sloshed over the roadside. Normally, a quiet picturesque slow flowing river, it was now boiling white & ejecting what looked  like  large surfing waves.\nA small group of pedestrians nearby were soaked as they lay, fell or knelt on the footpath. A large dog barked incessantly & ran in crazy circles.  Clouds of white dust appeared like a ghostly apparition from all directions as properties collapsed (mostly chimneys, walls & brick veneer) all around me.. Bricks & masonry lay across footpaths & roads wherever I looked. The narrow vehicle bridge across the River lay at a crazy angle having leaped from its moorings to land askew. White masonry dust created a lazy haze where much of the carnage occurred, turning shrubs & bushes into ghostly white apparitions.\nI could sense this was a big one, and with heart pounding, returned home slowly driving around debris, crevasses, burst water mains, liquefaction & stunned residents.\nOur driveway was blocked as a western brick wall had collapsed completely over it. I could see a sea of sparkling diamonds across our driveway & parking area where glass had fallen from above. The house showed several large cracks in the external walls & deep cracks across the driveway.\nInside was utter chaos, the kitchen cupboards & pantry having ejected their contents onto the floor creating a colourful blurb of glass, preserves, olive oil – you name it. Stuff all over the place, bedrooms, lounge, hallways. Even drawer sets on their face, TV’s down, paintings… Almost everything. \nPoor animals. Cat disappeared for a few hours & could only walk with his legs hooked up keeping his belly on the ground. Dearest Tinkerbelle jumped into my arms & shook continuously.\nI tried to reach Cathy  by phone, but the system appeared to have failed. It was some hours before we reunited & ascertained all other family members were OK.\nI drove back to work through the carnage, a trip taking 45 minutes that usually takes 6. The road & housing carnage was appalling & the sight of liquefaction continuing to actively manifest was an unbelievable vision. Piles of dark grey sand squirting with water like small active volcanoes. They grew in height and circumference  by the minute.\nAll staff had vacated our workplace. Most of the furniture, stock, desks, computers etc were on the floor. It was as if a maniac had run amok  intent on destruction & vicious vandalism. How they succeeded.\nAn eerie silence permeated everywhere, other than the wailing of car alarms, building alarms & the emergence of rescue vehicles. Shocked pedestrians walked aimlessly & traumatised drivers negotiated their way home taking horrible risks avoiding silt, pot holes, crevasses & crazed animals..\nShortly after, the whomp whomp of civil & military helicopters reverberated above as early rescue attempts & surveillance got underway.\nBack at home, family reunited & exchanged assurances of wellbeing. Water & power were off (for the following 8 days). Survival mode kicked in. So much to think about & do. Water collection, food preservation, toileting, others that may need help. We quickly discovered that ours, was only one of two in the street (of about 40), that remained intact & liveable.\nThe clean up inside was immense, so with all hands it was eventually achieved. Tricky trying to clean up without water though. Jim’s house a few blocks away was badly damaged. We took him home with us where he remains to this day. He’s doing well for 91 & contributes daily to our living chores with gardening, cleaning & workshop duties. Many broken things to fix…. Jim awaits a bed at Rannerdale war veterans retirement home.\nAs darkness fell, it was candles & torches until we final succumbed to exhausted sleep, fickle as it was through repeated aftershocks.\nMorning brought shock realisation as we listened to radio reports of the loss & devastation. How we grieve for our beautiful city & those loved ones that have perished. Helicopters appear continuously shattering the dawn silence as news crews, civil defence & politicians take stock. It was almost a week before we saw TV & Press articles, so we were mostly reliant on telephone calls from family & friends outside the zone to learn the true horror and the fuller extent of loss. It still seems like a bad dream as we move forward charged by adrenaline, fear & an almost feral primeval motivation to survive. Exhaustion is constant. Uninterrupted sleep improbable. Food reserves diminishing as the freezer thaws. A constant need to check on frail neighbours – delivering thermos after thermos & meals for those unable to care fully for themselves. We were blessed with plenty of BBQ gas for hot water etc. Water was taken from toilet cisterns & a neighbours swimming pool.\nTwo weeks later, we have water & power. What a delicious privilege. Back at work for Cathy & I. Things will never be the same. It’s Business as Unusual.\nThank you for all the calls, thoughts, prayers, words of encouragement and support. We’ll be OK.\n\nMuch love\n\nChris & Cathy & co",

Without thinking I ran outside, onto the road. I stood there, shivering, not quite knowing what was happening, looking down the road, down our valley onto the lights of Lyttelton. Then I heard a terrifying rumbling noise coming from behind me. \nThe ground rolled under me, and as the shock wave traveled down the road it extinguished every street light: first in our road, then broadening out across Lyttelton, then, as it traveled under the water of the Harbour nothing happened for a second or two, but as it arrived in Diamond Harbour, the lights there were extinguished as well. There was no more man-made light around me, only the stars and moon cast a faint light onto the freshly fallen snow on Mount Herbert and Mount Bradley. For a moment it felt as if the world had come to an end. It was one of the most terrifying and yet strangely beautiful things I have ever seen. I will never forget this moment.",

        "text": "Brooklands was hit hard by the first earthquake on 4th September 2010. It seemed bad, though damage elsewhere in the city was to be much worse during following earthquakes. \nWe were on holiday in Morocco for that first quake, and got the news by text message via London. We spent the rest of the holiday trying whenever possible to contact family and friends, and find information online. Neighbours reported that our house seemed to have stood up well, and we had very little liquefaction on our land. “If your house is damaged,” said our Moroccan guide, touching his heart, “you can have mine.”\nWe returned to find doors jammed shut and some books and small items on the floor. The house had settled on one side, but was otherwise remarkably intact. In due course the land report showed us to be zone B, able to rebuild without remediation, and we began to plan for what was looking like a rebuild due to the difficulties of relevelling the house.\nThen February came. The city was a horror, but in Brooklands our land was barely affected.  The house sagged a little further. The June quakes did not even cause liquefaction. CERA zoned us orange, while some of Brooklands went red. We stayed orange while other parts of the city and Kaiapoi were rezoned. Another round of rezoning a few months later left us again in limbo. \nThen in November, without any warning, we all receive letters telling us we are zoned red. The whole community, wiped off the map. I have lived here for 34 years. Others have even more emotional investment, but this is irrelevant. We have no say in the decision, no access to information, and no right of appeal. Some say the force of the earth makes them feel powerless, but CERA has been far worse for me.\nFor days after the announcement I can hardly speak. I have dreams that my family is being overwhelmed by huge waves and buried in sand, that we are being herded into trains to go to some grim destination, that someone has come while I was at work and cut down the huge gum tree my father gave me in a yogurt pot. \nNow it is December. At home the quakes on the 23rd made more things fall than any quake so far, but still we have no liquefaction on our land. Small mounds are piled at the gates of a few houses. Green zones elsewhere are meanwhile inundated. \nHere’s what I wish for all of us for 2012:\n\nMay the earthquake upheavals be behind us\n\nMay those in power find wisdom and compassion\n\nMay those displaced find strength and renewal\n\nAnd may we keep the community connection we have gained",

        "text": "I was in Australia for the Sept and Feb quakes, Melbourne for the first one and Brisbane for the second.  I haven’t been overseas in about 7 years prior to this and according to my friends I am not allowed to leave the country without giving them lots of notice :)\nMy first memory of the Sept quake is checking the time on my phone in the middle of the night and being surprised to have a text.  Its from my flatmate telling me about the 7.1 quake.  I quietly get up and throw on some clothes as I am sharing the room with a friend and find a chair in a hallway and call my flatmate.  Its about an hour after the quake NZ time, and he is shaken but alright.  The house is a mess but he can’t see clearly in the dark at the time (we are lucky and have no major damage in Sept due to our location)\nI call my best friend who assures me its OK and not that bad, but I am not entirely convinced as the sun is not yet up.  How can they know?  I go back to our room and wake my friend up, her family is in CHCH.  I loan her my work phone as I have international calling and she makes a couple of calls.  We turn on the TV and watch the footage in horror, and we both cry for a bit.\nI am up very early and find an internet cafe who are sympathetic when I tell them I am from CHCH.  I end up going in every day while I am still there, and they always ask how things are.  I check my emails and update my online status so people know I am OK and not in town.  When the timeframes coincide I call work.  My phone goes off many times during the next couple of days for work related calls.  I am checking my work emails on it during the day.  I have no idea what the cost of all that was, they paid it with no fanfare afterwards.\nMy holiday becomes torture as I cannot fly home even if I want to, as the airport is closed in CHCH, and I cannot afford to change flights.  I try to enjoy what I can of the next 4 days, its a great shame because the event I am at is a special one that only happens in our part of the world once every 10 years and I have waited a long time to attend.\nWhen I get home I find that the damage is localised and most of the city is undamaged.  Its horrific for those who have damage, but it isn’t as bad as it could have been.  Due to the luck of the timing no one is seriously injured or killed.\nIn Feb I was in Brisbane visiting my Dad and family who I had not seen for 7 years or so.  We were a couple of hours drive from home on the way to Currumbin when my half brother announced he had just seen on Facebook via his iPhone that another massive quake had hit CHCH and that the Cathedral had come down.  It was lunchtime NZ time and I didn’t know how really bad it was until many hours later when we made it home.  We carried on with our day and I tried not to think about it too much.  I had left my phone behind charging but called my best friend on Dads phone.  She is the staunchest woman I know and she was shaken and in tears.\nI knew then it was bad.  And when we finally got home and saw the TV footage it was unbelievabley bad.  This time the house was a real mess inside, and my poor flatmate was there cleaning it up again by himself.  \nThe next day I spent time discussing options to fly home early, but instead flew into Wellington and worked there for a week, as my team had other things to worry about.  It was one of the hardest things I have had to do, not just the amazing stress of all the work and urgency but not being able to be there, to be home, to be with my friends.\nEveryone always says when they hear I was away for the two big ones “You are lucky” but its incredibly hard to not be there.  Not really knowing what is going on is amazingly difficult to deal with.  Obviously not as difficult as having to be there, but still not easy.",

        "text": "Earthquake Story of Bertha & Robert Tobias.\n\nOn the 22nd February we had arranged to have lunch with two friends at the “Mediterranean” in Tuam street. One of our friends had been in hospital for three months and was having to use a walking frame to aid his balance.\nWe finished our lunch when suddenly a report like that of an exploding bomb occurred and the whole building began to shake. Our friend was unable to move so we held on to each other around the glass topped table. Fortunately we did this as those who leapt up were cut by the flying glass. A huge crack snaked it’s way across the floor as the staff helped everyone outside.\nEveryone was calm but shaking. The management pulled out chairs and brought out a first aid box. The staff were fantastic in the way that they cared for us all. We sat on the wall next to a young mother with a baby. She was a visitor to Christchurch. She tried desperately to call her family on her cell-phone but the service was out. We sat and comforted each other and watched with amazement as the tiny volcanoes of liquefaction shot up into the air followed by a flood of water from the broken pipes under the road.\nWe all realised that if we did not move soon that the road would be impassable. \nA second large jolt occurred as we fled to our cars. I asked the manager if we could pay for our lunches and he said “No forget about it.” We drove at snail’s pace down Barbados street and could see that the cathedral had been badly damaged. A striking sight was a statue of Mary facing a broken window.\nBumper to bumper it took us five hours to get home to Lyttelton a journey of usually 15 minutes. We picked up a couple of men who were running towards Lyttelton to their families but the movement of the traffic was too slow for them and we dropped them off again. When we finally reached the tunnel it was closed so we tried going toward the Ferrymead Bridge. That too was out and the only route left was up over the hills and towards Sumner Road. It was a challenge to negotiate the potholed and broken roads.\nWe finally reached the top of Evans Pass to find that Sumner road was impassable. We left the car at the top of the pass (as well as our cell phone much to the anxiety of our children overseas.)\nOn foot we climbed Chalmers Track. It was sheer adrenalin that kept us going as we are both in our seventies and of course unbeknown to us there had been landslides there too. We slid on our backs under fallen trees and around boulders the size of campervans which were strewn across the track. At one point we heard a roar behind us and looked back to see what looked like smoke, towards Sumner. Later we learned that it was dust from the collapsing cliffs.\nWe finally made it down towards Lyttelton and passed an astonished ranger who asked where we had come from. He told us that there had a couple of deaths on the hills.\nWe reached our home on Gilmour Terrace exhausted and then faced the wreckage inside the house. As we had a telephone that needs electricity to work we were unable to contact our family for a couple of hours. Our neighbour had an old telephone and we were able to reassure our family that we were still alive.\nEverything from the kitchen cupboards had fallen to the floor and brandied cherries, flour, rice, jam combined with the broken glass and crockery. A similar sight met our eyes in every other room. With no water we could not clean up the sticky mess so covered it all with newspaper so that we could walk in the kitchen and dining-room. \nWe had always kept an emergency kit which came into use immediately. We had enough water and food etc for about three days. The worst part of having no water is not being able to wash or to flush the toilet!\nWe did not sleep much that night. There were many big shakes. We contacted neighbours and the next day walked down in to the village to help with small things to make people feel that they were not alone.\nThe NZ Navy had been in port before the quake and the young crew members were marvellous in helping out around the village. They provided meals for those who had no electricity. The supermarket owner had all the stock from his shop taken to the Recreation Centre where he invited all to take what they needed. This ranged from fruit and vegetables to baby food, nappies etc.\nWhat was amazing to us was the way in which people overseas used facebook to locate family members.\n\nGoing down the hill next day to collect water we met a photographer with the international press. He was going to take photo’s in Sumner so took Robert with him to get our car back. He emailed us a few weeks later to see if we were ok.\nThe kindness and cooperation received from so many people was wonderful. \nRobert’s sister who lives in the United States wrote a lovely poem for him which we have attached.\nCHRISTCHURCH, 22 FEBRUARY, 2011\n\nGround boiling around you:\n\nliquefaction, they call it, earthquake\n\nnomenclature you knew because\n\nyouʼve always been at risk there.\n\nYou were in the city, buildings falling\n\neverywhere. Devastation in a few\n\nseconds. You escaped a building,\n\ncaught your breath, tried to drive\n\nhome, to Lyttelton, the epicenter.\n\nTunnel closed. Road over the hills\n\nblocked too. You clambered\n\nacross hills made unfamiliar\n\nby fallen boulders and trees to climb\n\nround or under and over. Your house\n\nhad swayed with the quake. Still there.\n\nChaos inside.

You were lucky, you said:\n\nmain street destroyed, neighborʼs house\n\nshifted from its foundation; most of all\n\nlucky not to be among the dead.\n\nLater, it strikes me how close\n\nyou came to death. You chose\n\nnot to follow the young men to whom\n\nyouʼd given a ride onto the bridle path\n\nabove the blocked tunnel. Was one\n\nof them the man you later heard was\n\nkilled there by a tumbling boulder? One\n\nof many ways you could have lost\n\nyour life. I could have lost you. I\n\nwant you to know itʼs not okay for you to\n\ngo before me, turning your lifeʼs last page\n\nwhile my book has more to be read.\n\nOur stories are interwoven. Your life\n\nis not separate from mine. Could I\n\nsimply continue my life if you\n\nwere suddenly not there? Iʼm\n\nnot sure Iʼd know how. Iʼd be\n\nlike parent losing child.

        "text": "The 22nd Feb 2011 will live in my mind for the rest of my life as I’m sure it will for a lot of true red and black blooded cantabrians, \nthis is my story….....\nIt was a fresh morning cool and overcast. I had worked until 1.30am that morning so i slept in a little and got up about 10.00am.\nI decided to go have lunch with my wife at wendys hamburgers on hereford st and then go to kiwi disposables to look at a new security belt for work. \nAbout 11.30am I headed out towards town. As I was driving through the CBD looking at all the damaged buildings and thinking about how the buildings were going to be fixed or rebuild it was a big job but knew it would be ok soon. \nI went to the cashel st carpark by the Hotel Grand Chancellor but it was full so i went to the crossing carpark by the bus exchange it was running full but thought id take the chance anyway.  I parked on the roof and went down to meet my wife on the cnr of Colombo and Hereford st outside the Hannifins building. \nWe had our lunch and I looked at my watch it was 12.45pm I said to my wife “should we go?” She said “na I just want to wait a while longer” then at around 12.50pm we got up and took our rubbish to the bin at the back of the restaurant. \nThen 12.51pm Tuesday 22 Febuary changed for my wife and I forever. It hit with no warning. It was like a bomb had been dropped on Christchurch. The ground moaned like a giant beast had been disturbed from its sleep, the building was cracking around us the screams echoed like we were in a war zone. We stood for a moment in the middle of the floor looking at what was going on around us. I said “I think the Alpine Fault has gone”. We threw ourselves under a marble table with another person and waited for the shaking to stop. It seamed to go on forever but when it did stop we got up and went to leave, I could see all the damage in the building. I was amazed the building was still standing. \nWhen we got outside I could not believe what I saw Christchurch had been destoryed, I could smell gas the building next to us had collapsed and I could see what I now know was a body under all the bricks and rubble. I was a mess my wife couldnt control me.  \nFor a moment I thought to my self why did I not die why do I have to live with this.  Then I realised I was still holding my large cup of rasberry and coke, I said to my wife “I need a rubbish bin” she said “I dont really think you need to worry about that right now” so I threw it away and headed on. \nWe headed down towards the building were my wife was working it was still standing. There was thousands of people milling around not knowing were to go or what to do. \nI saw a few people I knew I spoke to them and asked if they were all ok. \nMy wife told me she needed her bag and keys which were still in the building upstairs. I didnt want her going in but there was no other option. She went in with a few of her collegues, I didnt know what to do what will happen if there is an aftershock and shes still in there. Then I saw another person I knew he was helping a person that had a serious head injury so I helped to wrap his head and keep him calm. \nMy wife had since come down and was trying to find me I went over to her. Then the first aftershock hit and with power the buildings swayed and cracked with the movement. My wife said “were going now!!!!” Her car was behind the building she was working in. I wasnt happy about her going round there but we had no choice my car was not accessable and more then likely crushed and damaged in someway. She got the car and we left slowly down hereford st trying hard not to hit people as we went through the damaged streets and in between parts of buildings that was laying in the road that had fallen during the shaking. We went past the CTV building but I didnt realise at the time what had happened to it I just saw smoke and fire.  We headed down Linwood ave and saw more damage at Eastgate Mall and the shops accross the road on the cnr of buckleys rd and Linwood Ave. Its a feeling that I will never forget the helplessness of the situation and knowing that hundreds of people had died today still sends cold shivers down my back even today.\nAs the people Rebuild our broken city from the result of that horrific day we all remember how lucky we are to still be here and realize how short our live really are. My heartfelt sympathy goes to the family, friends and other loved ones who lost someone on that black day in christchurch history, but also remember that from the rubble we will rebuild a stronger safer christchurch. We will rise again christchurch, KIA KAHA BE STRONG!!",

When I was aware of what was happening  I didn’t believe him but I realised that he was not hallucinating and the ground beneath me was shaking. \nFear hit me like lightning and I started to do what the earth was already doing, shaking. I started to shake. I ran as quickly  as I could to stand underneath the door frame. My Dad came to me to tell me that everything was okay.  \nMy Mum and two sisters went to the mall in town. Trying to contact them was not easy. The phones were down and worry hit so hard I started to panic the thought of not being able to know whether  my mum and my sister were okay was torture. The next thing I knew I heard the car rolling up the drive and I breathed. A sigh of relief,  I was happy they were safe. \n                                  By Claudia Chernishoff",

        "text": "I wrote this on my blog on the day following the 22nd Feb earthquake.\nWe all survived a 7.1 quake, and you would think that the buildings that were unstable, had been bulldozed, or unoccupied. Imagine how bad yesterday would have been if they had still been there… as it is shudder it is bad. My city is levelled, and all I can say at the moment, bulldoze them all, only the cathedral needs to be rebuilt. I’m all for heritage but not at this cost. Imagine if Manchester Courts had still been standing, like some people protested.\nIt was only a 6.3, but it’s taken down buildings. The cathedral has lost its spire, the high risers that withstood the 7.1 collapsed. Were they weakened by previous quakes? They were structurally sound, but no longer earthquake proof??? I suppose in the months to come we will find out, now it’s about getting out the people trapped.\nThankfully, I work in a building that has been strengthened in the last 5 years. I was at my desk, trying to get work done and eat my lunch (can’t remember if I had finished it or not). There was a tremor, you are a bit “just a quake” about it for a moment (we’ve had a few over the last few months) . Then it gets stronger, you don’t think and you are under the desk. But then it get even stronger, you are being moved about and desperately trying to grab the leg of the desk to stop being thrown over the other side of the room. It finally stops.\nOthers in the room are yelling get out. I’m a little more relaxed, the building is still standing, and its stopped, what’s the panic? But I get caught up with the others panic and grab my bag and exit the building. I’m still rather relaxed down in the car park, one chick was bleeding, so I went to the medical centre (on the other side of the car park) and grabbed a nurse.\nAfter this point I took stock of the building, the level one window had completely blown out, covering the exit of the car park, and one of the horizontal beams had a big crack in it. I am a little less relaxed about the building and the quake now. No one wants to go past the building to exit the car park, so the back fence is kicked in the and we escaped out there.\nI probably spent half an hour outside on the street, it was slightly surreal, you tried to contact friends and family but no mobiles were working. There were rumours going around, from people walking past and the odd person who had managed to call someone, the cathedral was completely destroyed, a cliff had collapsed in Sumner. The traffic was already chokka by then, but I just wanted home. My car was parked next to a building that was looking a bit dodgy, so I rushed it, in and out. I quickest on record.\nI didn’t want to drive back through the city with all those dodgy  buildings, so I started to circle around the city. I found my self stuck in traffic down Memorial Ave, the radio was giving sketchy info and my cell was still not working. I eventually heard from my family in the city, that they were OK. It took 2hrs, but I eventually got home (in Cashmere), after coming through Hornby,  Halswell.\nWhen I got home, the house looked fine, the kitchen was a bit of a mess, a few glasses broken, but nothing serious. On the drive back, one of the things that was a main issue for me was Ironman (I was entered in Taupo Ironman in just under 2 weeks, it had dominated my life and thoughts for the last few months, so it was on my mind), yes rather selfish… will this have any effect on my race? First thought was for my bike, was it ok. When I walked in the door it was the first thing I checked… it was all ok, not touched, phew. It seems a meaningless worry now, a bike can be replaced.\nI finally managed to call my partner, he was over at his sisters who had power. I went and joined him, and finally got on the internet and saw the images for the first time. The Pyne Gould Guinness building totally collapsed, Cashel and High street look like a war zone… my old primary school in Redcliffs had the cliffs collapsed behind it.\nHis parents were also there, their place is in pretty bad shape. Neither of them had been home, thank god. Though his mother had been in Lyttleton (the epicentre) at the time. Then it was a case of trying to contact friends and make sure they are all OK. I think all close friends are OK, but who knows who else I know who are trapped or even dead.\nI’m not sure what will happen next, I think I will be very happy to get out of the city to Taupo next Tuesday",

Hamish was teaching at Uni, Claire was teaching at St Margarets, Elliot was at Thorrington School, and little Nina was at pre-school in a wooden 2 storeyed building but it was lunchtime and Nina was outside thank goodness.\nIt was a horrible quake.\nI was at home having my first sick day in 2 years and Pete was here too, which was good. If he had still been working for Pyne Gould Guinness he might have been in that building which completely collapsed where there are still people trapped.\nWe have only seen the TV images for the last few minutes but they look horrible. We can’t see the city from here though I gather some building is on fire.\nWe have a lot more breakages this time, and mess (think soy sauce, olive oil and olives 4 cm deep in broken stuff on the pantry floor) and several old things have broken this time, but they are only things. The 2 chimneys (or what is left of them after the Sept 4th one) have cracked and split again and the gas fire has parted from the wall, and there are more cracks, just after we’d been assessed for the last one. The water is not on yet and may be off for 5 days they think. We are not allowed to flush either.\nPeggy is unhappy about the all the noise and growls a lot. The aftershocks come every few minutes and are very noisy.\nWe imagine Hanmer will be fine, as it was last time, and I am keen to go there and sleep undisturbed, have a flush loo, and running water but Pete seems to want to stay here…we’‘ll review it in the morning.\n6.30am – a nightmare of a night lying there awake wondering about all those people trapped, and it has been drizzling, and every few minutes – more than 50 over 3 on the scale – vicious after shocks. Peggy slept between us and growled at the ones over 4, which seemed plenty. Some of our neighbours are camping out as they feel safer.\nI was worrying about 96 year old Eleanor, Patsy’s mother who is here in Bishopspark and they were damaged last time….",

        "text": "Alison’s Earthquake Blog/Panui\n\nThought I would send you a panui about what the earthquake meant for us and how it is affecting us all since. It has been so heart warming the generosity from everyone that I thought it was a way of acknowledging your thoughts and concerns about us.\nIt was amazing the quake was only 20 seconds long. But it wrought so much damage. Our first one in September was 40 seconds long.  The Tokyo earthquake was 4 minutes long!!! A neighbour from here was in Tokyo for their quake and he said it just rolled and but ours felt more violent. Paul was at home for both quakes so he had an idea how they both felt and in the 22 Feb quake he thought our house would fall down and we had no damage! Imagine what it felt like for people with damage. Our quake was so violent because it went up and down and across. Houses went up in the air with the first bit then the ground sunk underneath them so they fell very heavily (I think that’s how it went). We can no longer say “that felt like a 4” or what ever because we have learnt the magnitude is only a small part of the equation.\nUs\nI thought you may like to know what we were all doing on the day. I think one of the most terrifying stories was our granddaughter – Reni. Her school is in the middle of town. I think her building was okay but when they were evacuated onto the street they had to take her past people with blood on them and other people that she said were just lying on the road. Briar was beside herself because she didn’t know if she was safe. She ran to town to find her. There was little cell phone coverage as they all jammed with overloading. You were lucky if you got through and some people didn’t know for hours what had happened to their loved ones.\nMike, Briar’s husband also was working in the middle of town. He is a policeman so he was straight out into the streets helping people. He hasn’t said much but when I asked him how they coped with the after shocks (they were major, very violent), he said you just had to be careful where you were standing. He didn’t get home until 1 am.\nLucy (Matene’s wife) was home on her own with the three littles (4, 2 and 4 months). She was thrown across the kitchen with a child in her arms. Everything flew out of the cupboards and smashed, TVs, printer fell, drawers flew out of the cabinets, cabinets fell over. Fridge thrown across the other side of the kitchen. She then had to watch as the water rose up outside from the liquefaction. They had an electric garage door opener and she didn’t know how to over ride it. Her cell phone didn’t work and no electricity for the other phone. She didn’t know how high the water was going to rise and she didn’t know how she was going to carry 3 littles if she had to evacuate. Matene was normally ½ hour away working and it took him 3 ½ hours to get home because of road damage and huge traffic jams.\nI was at Polytech (which is in the middle of town) doing a course. I was only on the first floor and it didn’t feel too bad. My arms and legs shook a bit but okay. Then I had to walk home (I had caught the bus in). I could see dust rising from the city centre, hear sirens, so thought I had better not go that way, so went out as far as I could away from tall buildings. There was bricks all over the roads, bridges sunken in, liquefaction starting to pour out of the ground. That was all okay until people started coming out from the middle of town and the looks of their shell shocked faces. People weren’t talking, just pale and big eyed. It was like we had been in a war. At this stage I had no idea what had happened in town or anywhere. Finally I asked someone listening to a radio, had people been killed and they said they thought so. It took me approximately 3 hours to walk home what normally may have been 1 hour. To this day I couldn’t tell you which street I walked down, you were so traumatised. There were no buses and many cars were stuck in car parking buildings, which we are finally getting back now. Many have been destroyed though. I walked with people that may have walked for 5 or so hours just to find out if their children were okay. I had a friend who was a teacher and she said they still had children there at 5 pm because their parents hadn’t arrived. There were sirens sounding like I’ve never heard before, all different tones. They’ll haunt me for ever.\nBriar ran from the University to her boys school and one of them said, “what did you come for, I want to play!” The miracle of it was that not one child was killed at ChCh schools, it may have been because it was lunch time and they were playing outside. Many schools have severe damage and they are having to double up, two schools into a day on one site. Reni’s school has had to move to a whole new site.\nHow bad was it? Well aside from the deaths, approximately 12,000 houses have severe damage or are totally written off. At the first earthquake there were 1200 road repairs to be made, this quake 38,000! Can you imagine one of your main arterial routes like Wellington motorway or Parakai Drive in Auckland having a hole underneath the road that could fit a huge truck and trailer in it! Initially to get anywhere was hair raising. There were big sink holes, huge piles of liquefaction – it used to take my friend ¼ hour to drive to work and initially after the quake – 1 ½ hours for the same journey! But the workmen in ChCh have been absolutely amazing. They are doing 24 hour shifts, and the roads are steadily being fixed. Awful part is though it is often only temporary as they have to do major pipe repairs underneath the roads so will be all ripped up again. You just are so grateful, when you see workmen you yell out thank you. They get huge wishes of thanks in the paper. I was going to work one morning and on a really dangerous huge rise in the road there at 6 am they were working on lowering it!!! Such an essential part of our recovery. It was amazing what things gave you pleasure after the quake. Two days after the quake, down our street trundled the rubbish man and his truck. He stopped and talked to us, and I told him how grateful we were to see something normal like the rubbish being picked up.\nThings to be grateful for -\nWe’re all alive, not injured and our houses are mainly alright.  \nPost earthquake – Lucy, Matene and whanau came to live with us for more or less 11 days. They had no water, power or sewage. Also Lucy’s grandparents for a few days as their house was a huge mess with broken things. There was a huge shifting of people all over the city. We had no power for three days but everything else okay. We got out the BBQ, had gas lamps, small cookers and we coped, can you imagine no power and 9 people, just like camping. At one stage Matene etc were here and their friends were in their house as their friends had no amenities for much longer. We would pack up our washing and decamp to someone who had power. I saw people with freezers on the back of trailer moving them to someone with power.\nIt was like a war zone for weeks – Iroquois helicopters thumping overhead, army tanks thundering down the road, soldiers, security, police every were and you were thrilled to see them. \nAt our house though if you walked outside you nearly could have said – “earthquake what earthquake?” it looked so normal in the street. But this made you feel guilty as you knew how much others were suffering. You felt like it was more difficult to emphasise. You felt like to be part of the city you needed to have had damage happen to you.\nOur city was one of Hi Vis vests, it is just the latest!!! It seemed like for weeks the only people out and about were men and women in work vans, trucks etc in high vis. \nTo get into my work through the barriers I had to provide ID (in little old NZ!) and I had to answer questions about were I worked etc. \nThere were and still are road blocks everywhere. You have no idea at times how to get from one place to another with shut roads. Our roads were full of those huge concrete barriers.\nAll the buildings in the inner city have graffiti on their walls and this is okay. They have the date on them and things like “clear” as well as cars in inner city. Showing they have been checked for bodies etc.\nHow did it affect my wider circle? \nA nurse I worked with was killed when bricks fell on his car, 4 nurses in the ward have houses that are just liveable but may be demolished. One nurse had a Japanese student that was killed. The nurses with jiggered houses have things like half of the house learning away from the other half, outside doors that don’t meet, windows with holes around the edges.\nPaul’s mate in England, cousin was killed and I think her flat in the CBD is still closed off.\nAt least one nurse had a partner that has lost his job.\nEveryone has a story to top another story like the Irish do (you know my life was so tough as a child I slept under the house!) Seriously my hairdresser lived up on the hill and all her cupboard door flew off in the kitchen. Other people said their toilets flew off the wall and another said the toilet then flew down the passage.\nHow are we in our selves\nWe had horrendous after shocks they went on all night very strong. But miracle of miracle we feel very few now, not like the first earthquake were we had 100s that we felt and left you unnerved.\nThe memorial service was the best thing to have happened. It was so healing. I sobbed when they showed what the damage was. We saw very little of that on TV because we had no TV so really didn’t know what the CBD looked like.\nPeople are stressed. People you would never think who would be have been very weepy and thought to myself at one stage I needed to be careful. But much improved.. A girl I work with who seems to be as tough as old boots admitted to feeling weepy. We have talked about it over and over again. Not so much at work now. It’s still there though. One of my grandsons was in the bath and I pulled the plug and it made a gurgling sound and he did an enormous start. Not right for a little fellow to be like that at four. You are weary when you hear thumps, bangs, odd noises as you wonder if its an earthquake. \nWe do things like keep our dressing gowns at the end of the bed, just in case we need them. I always have my cell phone handy. Some people carry torches and whistles just in case. I push things back into the back of the cupboard so they wont fall out; we keep 10 litres of fresh water in the shed, \nThe feeling of gratitude we have for each other and the rest of New Zealand knows no bounds. It absolutely blows us away how supportive everyone has been. Thank you to you all. I hope you all can bear with us till we get ourselves up and going again. I’m afraid we may be a big drain on New Zealand, thank you again.\nToday\nWe still have big trouble on our roads, but it is because of the repair crews, mainly at night. They close parts off so they can start putting in pipes etc. Lots of the roads are sealed now, although still parts not. Very bumpy though, no good for boy racers. Some parts that are really bad have a 30k speed limit because they shake the houses that are damaged. Outside my work is water tanks as we cant use the water from the taps as not guaranteed safe. I cant imagine going to work in the morning saying “whose boiling the water today?”, new generators and boilers as the emergency generators were not very reliable. At home we are not allowed to flush our toilets unless it is brown, not for wee. Only 30% of the pumping stations working. Lucy and Matene still have to use chemical toilets. You can smell sewage at Matene and Lucys from the sewage ponds.\nYou make sure your pictures are well anchored, looking at anchoring our bookcases etc to the walls. I remember years ago, Mark Ellis advising us to do this on TV and you just looked and thought no more about doing it. Different story now.\nI read the local paper front to back as there is heaps of information about what is happening. Normally you only give it a bit of a glance.\nBut guess what? We are moving ahead, we have tents going up in Hagley Park so we can have some entertainment and for World Cup rugby etc. We are having meetings to talk about how we see the future for ChCh. It is exciting as we are going to have the most modern city in NZ. There is a sense of future hope in town. People are so resilient. We will be okay. People are starting to get repairs started and completed.\nWe have our new fire operating.\nThank you a million again. We feel the most enormous aroha to you all\nAlison and whanau",

I was in the bathroom with one little girl, when the shaking started I scooped her up to run back to the classroom to comfort the other children but I couldn’t stay on my feet.  I ended up on the floor, holding that wee girl tight, terrified.  I could hear the children screaming in the classrooms, I kept calling out ‘turtle turtle’ like we’d practiced but they were too scared to remember what to do.  \nWhen it stopped and I got back to the classroom I held my head and made eye contact with another teacher, I think I just said “that was big…bigger”.  I took a few seconds to just feel what I felt – shock I guess, then I sprung into action, comforting and congratulating the kids to reassure them, running from room to room to check on the teachers and children throughout the centre.  We were all ok, very scared but ok.  As a team we were stellar – supporting one another and making great decisions for the children, comforting distressed parents as they ran in, often filthy, sweating and crying having run from town and seen horrific scenes on their way. \nI have children too – that was the hardest thing, I couldn’t get to them, I couldn’t get any contact with them, I had to wait two hours til I could be a parent and run to them too.  I have so much more to tell but don’t think I can right now, how I got to my kids, what happened to us, our friends, how we found each other, how we got through the night of 22nd Feb, the worst night of my life.

        "text": "A fateful week in Christchurch\n\nThis account was written shortly after the Christchurch Earthquake of February 22nd, 2011\n12:50 pm, 22 Feb  – Business as usual, a typical Tuesday.. \n\n12:51 pm  –  6.3, 5kms deep\n\n I was talking with a work colleague when the shaking started. There was no lead in,  no warning. Unwanted violence from out of the blue. I looked over to my work colleague, I could see it in his eyes that after experiencing five months worth of aftershocks he and I both knew this was far from normal.\nDUCK!!\nI dived under my desk, as the suspended ceiling above it collapsed. An aluminium frame had dropped on the diagonal with ceiling panels, and the suspended light fitting hanging only by it’s cord was swinging where I had been standing just seconds before. The violence was intensely stronger than the 7.1 of Sept 4, and when the shaking stopped I extricated myself from the mess that had fallen over my desk to see all my work colleagues, faces white with shock, emerge all physically unharmed.\n\n12:56pm – 4.9, 5km deep\n1:05 pm  – 5.7,  6km deep\n\nA work colleague and I left the work carpark immediately to the sounds of alarms, sirens and crying. On the way out I saw a meeting of emergency personal already in vests mobilising to enter the city, already a lot of people were attempting to leave and these people were about to make their way in. I knew something terrible had happened by the stunned looks on everyones faces with the disbelief that this had happened again – but worse.\nOn the way home there were buildings that had fallen down, chimneys fallen through roofs, water mains had burst causing flooding and in places the road had lifted or sunk. One part of the road on the way out of the city had risen half a foot. There was the smell of fear and raw sewage in the air.\nI called Kiri and let her know what had happened, and to let family know I was ok. I managed to get the call out before the network failed.\nMy work colleague dropped me at the corner and he went to find his wife and children who were all in different places within the city.\n1:21pm –  4.5, 5km deep\n1:26 pm – My street was a mess, there had been massive energy waves which had buckled and split the road. I sprinted up my now uneven driveway and fumbled the key into the door and opened to the mess awaiting me inside.\n\nI took stock of what had happened, nothing damaged thank goodness, just a bit of mess to clean up. I found my very scared cat under the bed in the spare bedroom and then took a look outside….this was when things got interesting.\n\nLiquifaction – This was bubbling up outside like nothing I had ever seen before, and it kept on coming. Worse was yet to come when I noticed that water was gushing up from under the house and flooding the yard with silt. The water had built up so quickly it had flooded my laundry and garage. It kept coming and I realised if I didn’t do something quickly my house was going to flood too. \nI ran to the gate and turned off the water mains, and then round the corner to the Creche next door and got them to turn their water off too to see if this would help. On the way back I checked in on the elderly neighour who lived over the fence to see if he was ok – he was.\nI ran back up the drive and assisted a neighbour with her wall divider as she couldn’t lift it by herself. \nBack inside I had a look out and the water had kept on coming, there was nothing else for it but to get knee deep in it so I took my shoes and socks off, grabbed a spade and barefoot,  there I was outside digging channels to divert the water away from my lounge.\nI looked down part way through to find I was standing in raw sewage and the flooding and my handy spade work had uncovered an ants nest struggling for survival. \n\nThere were live ants crawling up my leg. Knee deep in sh*t all afternoon, the irony wasn’t lost on me.\nThe aftershocks kept coming. These came without warning with huge booms – they were not gentle rolling shakes, they came with extreme violence.\n1:46pm – 4.5, 5km deep\n2:50pm – 5.9, 5km deep\n3:48pm – 4.5, 5km deep\n4:04pm – 5.0, 12km deep\nI finished the channels and then waited…\n\n\nI had saved the lounge, the water had stopped flowing, I was dirty and covered in goodness knows what, with no water and no power, but I was alive and uninjured.\nI used old bottles of water stored from the 7.1 Earthquake in Sept last year to wash myself off, and I went back outside to see who I could help around the neighbourhood, and was left wondering if this was all actually happening.\nPower came back on just before dusk Tuesday night, I was never more relieved to hear the fridge shudder into life and buzz away happily, I remember checking all power appliances carefully to make sure there was no risk of fire.\nI was not prepared to see the images on TV that evening of the carnage within the city, MY city. Tears flowed as it hit me just how bad this was. The rest of the world had known for many hours what I was only just finding out. I realised life here was never going to be the same again, and this was not a bad nightmare, it was real and 2.5km’s from where I live people were trapped in buildings injured, dying and with many dead.\nI eventually went to bed.\nFeb 23rd  2011 – Wednesday. There was no sleeping to be had during the night, every half hour at least there was a 4 or 5 magnitude aftershock. I used Wednesday to clean up the house, and I slept. I started a bit of cleanup outside but I knew without tarps, newspapers or a wheelbarrow I wasn’t going to achieve much.  I went for a look around the neighbourhood. The formerly flat road in places was now like the surface of the moon. Some places the road had sunk a meter, like it had just been melted away.\nFeb 24th  2011 – Thursday. I went door knocking. I borrowed a wheelbarrow from a neighbour in the next block and I kept knocking on at least 3 doors with no answer as people had vacated Christchurch. One house had newspaper but they could not access the spare room it was in as a cabinet had fallen across the door, sealing everything inside. I managed to get a lot of newspaper from an elderly gentleman who was attempting to shovel the liquifaction from his pathway to his house. I offered to help but he had people arriving to assist and he declined so I got back to the job at hand.\nBeating a path to the door to get access to the wash house, and then the sight that greeted me when I finally got there.\n\n\nI had to take dirt and silt through the house as the garage was blocked. Load after load, after load. \n\nIn the afternoon as my back and arms were killing me, as I was dumping the dirt on the road for what seemed like the thousanth time, a car pulled up and a guy handed me a cold can of Sprite lemonade.  A groundswell of emotion hit me and I almost burst into tears on the spot at the sheer kindness. His car was loaded with cans. It was his way of making a positive difference during a time where we were all trying to process everything we were experiencing. A car behind it also yelled out some positive affirmation for me as it went passed. I must have looked deflated and knackered. This was enough to recharge me to continue with what was necessary.\nAs I came back up the drive way my neighbour Kavita informed me that the water to the outside taps was now back, it had low pressure, and not enough to run the taps inside but it was something positive – we now no longer had to source water off the property. I knocked on the neighbours doors to advise that water was back, a particular neighbours friend who was visiting offered to help shovel the dirt with me.\nI graciously accepted and as we were shoveling he advised me his name was Brad and was in the Australian Airforce. He was over here on his own accord as he just wanted to help and he had piggy backed a flight from Australia with the Australian Search and Rescue team – he even had his own shovel.\nHe helped for two hours and with some more help from another neighbour at the end my back yard ended up looking completely different….I went to bed that night exhausted but satisfied at the progress that had been made.\n\nFeb 25th  2011 – Friday. The day Kiri came home. After travelling since the early morning. Kiri, who I hadn’t seen for the better part of 7 weeks came bursting through the door just before 8pm with food, water, emergency supplies (which included comfort food – hmmm chocolate), and lots of morale boosting cuddles.\nFeb 26th  2011 – Saturday. The landlords arrived and assisted with shovelling the rest of the dirt out to the road from behind the garage, and Kiri and I got stuck into taking everything out of the garage and sorting out what was damaged and what could be saved. \n\n\nI contacted a work colleague that evening who had water and Kiri and I went round and had a shower each. This was the first shower I had had since Monday night the 21st of Feb and it was….AMAZING!!!!\nFeb 27th  2011 – Sunday. Earthquake? – What Earthquake?  Pipes have been repaired as we now have mild water pressure to the taps inside and can flush the toilet.\nFeb 28th  2011 – Monday.\n\nThe two separate piles of dirt outside on the street from mine and the 5 other townhouses I share my driveway with. In the distance you can see rubble on the ground and if you look carefully you can make out the bumps where the energy released has warped the road.\nThe dust now that we have had a couple of nice sunny days is unreal. All we need is there to be tumble weeds shipped in to make for an authentic Old West experience.\nThe picture below is of St Martins a suburb just 2 minutes drive up the street. The photo does not do it justice but this road is now like the moon, it used to be flat and it is wet due to burst pipes. To the left behind the Westpac bank is the St Martins New World supermarket. This has had extensive damage and will be closed. Hundreds of employees will lose their jobs. You can also see how close the Port hills are to where I live. Most of the EQ’s have been under the Lyttleton side of the hills.\n\nMar 1st  2011 – Tuesday. It is now a week since the 6.3 Earthquake changed Christchurch and our lives forever. At 12:51pm Kiri and I held hands and sat in silence for two minutes in respect of those that lost their lives, and remembering all that has happened in the last week. Has it been a week? It feels like it’s only been two days.\nIn context to where Christchurch sits in history, the New Zealand census has been cancelled this month. It has only happened twice before – During the Great Depression of the 1930’s and during WWII. The cost of rebuilding Christchurch City is now going to cost more than the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina which hit New Orleans in 2005.\nTomorrow and beyond\nWho knows what the future holds for Christchurch and even if there are going to be more big quakes. These are strange days. My work is within the cordon of the CBD and will be out of bounds for at least two months. I have offered to work up in Wellington office from next week for two months until the cordon is lifted or until we get relocated to a surrounding surburb temporarily. \nAt least for now, I am still getting paid. Kiri and I consider ourselves lucky. Many do not have water or power, they are displaced out of their homes, and have loved ones who have died or been seriously injured. A lot of people will never lose their physical or mental scars.\nThere is hope and love in spades here and I am in awe of how we have picked ourselves up and continue to do everything to help each other, our friends, our neighbours, and complete strangers. Tomorrow morning at 5am I am heading out with friends to deliver coffee and food to those working on the cordons in the city. Kiri today has been busy baking cookies, mini muffins and scones which we will be handing out in the early hours.\nLook how far this city has come in a week. We at this stage will not be leaving Christchurch, This is our home and Kiri and I are here to create a new future for the new Christchurch which will emerge.\nLastly a big thank you to all of you that phoned, emailed, text messaged, asked after us and held us in your thoughts, it has truly made a world of difference.\n\nMuch love to all,\n\nScott and Kiri",

I hear a smashing window to my rear, twice. \nBack up 66 steps to the Nieghbours, they are OK but lots of broken stuff, tell them I think they have a window broken and they say a friend will check on it later.  Back down the steps and home to a mess.  The house had its tiled roof  removed after Sept, and still little pieces of roof tile fell out cracks in the inside walls.  Big tidy up, and then back to the rental to see the damage, as the owners were due back in 3 days, and believe it or not 2 plastic containers had fallen in the pantry, and that was all.   My car back at the friends house had locked its steering, it got shaken about so much.  Rocks that were pinned by Cerra, above the friends house had swiveled on their access.  One rock fell and grazed one of their parked cars.  The town of Lyttelton was very quiet for the afternoon, till people settled down in the evening and the street brightened up with folk.",

        "text": "We have four children, ages 12, 14, 14 and 16. The effects on them of earthquakes have been what i would consider “character building”. At first, there was a lot of crying from my two youngest daughters (12 and 14). Whenever there was a big aftershock following September, my 12 year old was absolutely terrified and cried and clung to the doorway. \nThe first day of the 7.1 was horrendous…i was shaking more than the ground and unfortunately that transferred to my daughter. In the end, I had to pull it together and used a lot of humour to help her through (eg, “don’t think that just because the ground is shaking, you don’t have to take your medicine/do the dishes” etc). I gave her a soft cuddly toy rabbit and told her that he would be very scared when there was an aftershock, so she needed to squeeze him tight…it worked well for her. \nOften, her and my 14 year old daughter would sleep in the same bed if it was a shaky night…with the door open and the light on. One night was particularly bad…all i could hear was them screaming each time. In the end, i told them that every time they screamed i thought they were hurt, i know you are scared but try and cuddle up instead. Next time there was a house dropping jolt and big shake…no screaming. Rushed into their room worried sick…two pairs of wide eyes looking at me, they listened and didn’t scream. My 16 year old shares a room with my 12 year old, would often hear her say things like “don’t worry, you know Geonet says it’s good for the small ones to happen, it releases energy so the bigger ones don’t happen” (haha). So she was mothering her. My 14 year old son doesn’t seem to be phased. My 14 year old daughter ended up getting angry at the aftershocks keeping her awake at night…we would hear an angry “GO AWAY!!” at 1.30am or whenever. Now the first thing they will say is “ooh Mum, wonder what size that was/whereabouts in Chch/how deep” and they all rush off to check Geonet. \nThey have come through it really well, no major issues so far (fingers crossed). Lots of cuddles and reassurance from me when they need it…the angriest i have felt was just this year, my 14 year old has had major hip/femoral surgery. Had to leave her at the hospital and collect the other kids from school, about 30 – 40 mins away. Sitting at the lights and the car starts rocking…looked around, everyone else looked confused too for 5 seconds, then “ooohhh….”. Texted my girl straight away…got back “oml Mum that was scary, the bed was rocking, but the nurses checked on me”...never felt so powerless because i couldn’t go straight back to her and knew she couldn’t even leave her bed. I have asked all my kids if they think we should live somewhere else, their immediate response was “no…why? this is our home!!” \nAm proud of them all, and watch them very carefully even now things are quieter…sometimes i have to leave them at home in the school holidays when i work, have a cellphone on at all times, work 10 minutes down the road….usually they text straight away, “we’re all okay Mum, are you okay?” they know the drill….get under the doorways straight away, look out for each other. Last time i rushed home from work (Dec 2011, two close shocks together and littler ones) to them, i cried all the way home…and i knew they were okay!! Just stressful…and wondering how the people in the CBD/East got on, they were told to go straight home and check their houses out. When i got home, my 14 year old was upset because one of my favourite coffee mugs had smashed…was so relieved they were okay :) Luckily i was home after the first 5plus and with them for the 6 that followed…all okay but as their Mum, think it upsets me more than them if i’m not there. They are amazing kids.",

I shouted out, “Stop shaking the bed would you?”, to my older sister above me.\n\nIn the meantime she was saying ‘It’s not me, it’s you.” Seconds later Mum rushed into our room with an extra worried face and a crying baby in her arms, telling us to get under the door frame. By then I was sitting up thinking\n\n “WHATS HAPPENING?”\n\nThe noise was deafening, as the timber of the walls swayed and cracked. Photo frames could be heard crashing and smashing to the floor.\nCuriously my sister and Mum were standing at the doorway, while I completely woke up and realised that what was going on was the first EARTHQUAKE I had ever experienced in my life.\nThere was a knock on our door almost 30 seconds after the earthquake. We had absolutely no idea who it could be. Mum had a feeling it might already be EQC.\n\nWe were all thinking it would be a bit too early for EQC, as we were approaching the door. We opened it and were glad to see who was at the other side, our neighbours Frances and Joshua.\nAfter Frances and Joshua showed up we were all crunched up under blankets, listening to our battery powered radio. As it came closer to dawn, we all went on a walk around our small, old house, to see the damage and cracks in the walls. Smashed glass splattered all over the carpet, water splashed drip by drip onto the floor from the vase of daffodils on the table. All our photo frames were damaged, cracked and lying on the floor. In the end we were lucky that the power had gone out, because the heater was lying flat on the ground with the cord still connected and switched on.\n               That day we found out the earthquake was a 7.1. \n\n                                                                      :)",

        "text": "Day 7 February 2011: On Monday morning, my husband and I drove down the hill and saw ‘closed road’ signs blocking the road to the city.  The only way in and out of Sumner was via Evans Pass, over Summit Road, and down Mt Pleasant.\nAnd so we turned right and headed through the village, passing the huge rock which has fallen down from the backside of our hill onto the RSA building.  At least one body lies beneath the rockfall there, if it has not been recovered.  Our neighbour’s after-funeral gathering was to have been there within the hour after the quake.\nWe then drove up the valley toward Evans Pass, dodging a couple sizeable cracks and dips.  This wasn’t long after the early morning 4.1M aftershock which later caused concern in the area; getting back home later would prove to be a bit of a mission.  \nTurning right, we followed Summit Road.   We drove over to Mt Pleasant, and talked about how we’d been planning to bring my sister’s nephew to the top of Mt Pleasant and set him loose on a mountain bike.  The ride down the hill takes several minutes, no pedalling required.\nAs we drove down the hill, we looked for views of the city, hoping to catch a glimpse of the central city.  Normally, you would also see the spire of the Cathedral, sadly missing this day.  \nWe were somewhat amused to see the rubbish trucks out and about.  Services have not been as quick to open as they were in September, but some services are starting again.  Rubbish trucks are picking up bins full of broken items and household rubbish, in an effort to minimise the risk of disease.  Normally, we have 3 different types of rubbish trucks: yellow (recycling) runs every fortnight (two weeks); green (compostable items such as food, garden clippings, etc.) every week; and red (all other rubbish) every second week.  This week, there was no separation, and all trucks were picking up all bins.\nWeaving our way through backroads, we made fairly good progress to my workplace, where we each showered.  My husband then set off for his workplace, and I met with my team.  I learned that the server had finally failed on Sunday, thus leaving me without access to my files.  In the early afternoon, one of my staff offered to drive me home.  Thus began our adventure!\nI grabbed a veggie delight sub at Subway and we headed across the city.  We decided to drive straight toward Sumner, seeing how far we could get.  When we reached the closed roads, we were told we could access Sumner by going up Mt Pleasant, across Summit Road, and down Evans Pass – in other words, a reverse of the morning trip.\nSo, up we went.\nAnd across we went.\nWe were told that the aftershock that morning had caused concerns of rockfall on the road down to Sumner, but that we could take the 4WD track down the hill, as the police had opened it for Sumner residents.  We went through the gate and about that time saw people farther down the hill waving us back.  Some 15 or so vehicles slowly travelled back up the hill, with their police escort advising that heavy traffic was making the road unstable. \nWe got as far as the pine trees at the top of our hill before seeing that the road was closed.  An army vehicle blocked the road down toward Evans Pass.\nHoly sheep!  I was not able to get home, and was about to ask if I could walk down the hill.  We called another of my team members and asked if she could find any information online; she reported that it looked like Sumner was totally blocked off.  I just wanted to get home, even if it meant I was trapped there.\nAbout that time, we saw another rubbish truck go past us.  It was allowed down the hill, raising my hopes again.  We drove back to the checkpoint, and were asked if we were residents; I advised that I was, and we were allowed down the hill.  At the top of Evans Pass, we were stopped at another checkpoint, repeated my address to them, and were allowed to pass.  We wondered if my driver would be able to get back UP the hill and out again, or if I would have to put him up for the night.\nMy husband brought home a few grocery items to restock the fridge, and we used the stove to prepare our meal.  Small victories!  The rest of the evening is a bit of a blur to me now.",

        "text": "The first earthquake, in September, shocked us all. One moment, we were happy, had plans and our futures planned out – the next, it was ripped from us in one shaking motion in the early hours of the morning. I’ll never forget waking up with my boyfriend holding onto me and roaring in my ears as I watched my books and dvd’s flung to the floor by an unseen force. My boyfriend, being from Wellington said ‘Calm down, it’s just a little earthquake.’ but as it grew strength, even he leapt from the bed and joined me under the doorframe. \nAfterwards, the house was full of confusion and uncertainty.\nWe were the sort of family that didn’t have a plan in case of an emergency. We all huddled under our big doorframe, clinging each other and listening to the radio, with only torches for light.\nThen we heard a man on the radio. ‘There’s water up to our knees, we’re in Brighton-’ \nOf course, we feared the worst – a Tsunami. Later we learnt that was the first stages of liquifaction.\nAfter some time, we got used to the aftershocks, and confusion turned to complete knowledge of all things geological. Everybody in Christchurch knew the words ‘Liquifaction, earthquake, aftershock, richter’ etc, and used them on a daily basis. \nApart from the odd larger aftershock, things were slowly beginning to return to normal, buses resumed, shops reopened, cracks were repaired. \nAnd then February 22nd rolled along. \nI remember parts of the day perfectly, and others I can only guess at.\nI had just got a job at a local supermarket in Parklands, and I was due to sign my contract that day. My sister and mother both were meant to be on Bealey ave, but by some amazing stroke of luck, both of their alarms had failed to wake them. So my sister was getting ready to bus into town, and my mother was in the kitchen on the phone.\nAt 12:45 I was in bed, being lazy and checking my Facebook on the computer. I was about to get up and shower, when suddenly my monitor went black. I called out to mum and was about to say ‘Power’s gone out!’ and then my monitor flew forward onto the ground and everything turned into rubber. The walls flung backwards and forwards and I remember seeing my curtains flying. I knew instantly this was worse than September, so I didn’t bother with the doorframe. I forced myself into the hall and attempted to get outside. \nThis part is hazy, I might have hit my head – but I remember being thrown back and forwards into walls and a heater. Finally, I got to the front door and my mum almost got there but slipped over.\nI always assumed if I was in a life or death situation I would save myself, but I shocked myself at that moment by running back into the house and pulling mum out with me. We held each other outside, crying, until it stopped. My sister came out afterwards.\nThe hours after the earthquake were almost as bad as the quake itself. My boyfriend and dad were working in the city, and as the phone lines were down, I didn’t know if they were okay. Then my neighbour came home, white as a ghost, and said that their were dead bodies lying in the streets, and that the cathedral had all but collapsed. \n\nWe just sat on the side of the road, crying. All we could hear were yelling, alarms going, cars racing past and people running around. After a while, the liquifaction got worse and cars were just abandoned. My stepmother and dad walked to our house in bare feet, as the roads surrounding Broadhaven ave were covered in silt and mud. \nFour and a half hours after the earthquake, my boyfriend made it home – he had been working on Moorhouse and almost got crushed. His car had mud marks up to the windows from driving through Aranui. \nThe days afterwards were hard, waiting to hear from friends and family to make sure they were safe, boiling all our water and camping in our own backyard. \nMy life plan was based in Christchurch, I wanted to study there, work and raise my children in the city. I had been in love with Christchurch ever since I was a little girl. Now the city is all but gone. \nEveryone in Christchurch is so strong, and brave and amazing. The earthquakes have been such a terrible, life-changing event. Keep going Chch <3",

        "text": "I thought things were odd on February 22nd when I crossed the causeway to take my son to preschool in Redcliffs and the tide was incredibly high. I have crossed the causeway many times and had never seen the tide this far up and appeared to still be coming in. After dropping Small Boy off I crossed back over the causeway and saw the tide was still coming in. It was so odd, and so high that I did another lap around McCormacks Bay and stopped and had a look. Yep, it was still coming in. We were late to preschool that day, so it was about 10 am when I first crossed towards Redcliffs, and about 10.30 when I returned. When I got home I thought I’d check the tide timetable (I’m a nerd like that). High tide was expected at 7.31am in Lyttelton, making it around 8.30am in the Estuary. Very strange indeed. \nStranger still was the cat, who kept ‘chatting’ at me in a Lassie-like fashion, which I ignored as he’s often trying it on for more food. I should have listened to him.\nIt was my second day at university for the year and so I gathered up a note pad and pen and drove out towards university in time for a lecture at 1.10pm. Waiting at the lights to turn onto Maidstone Rd off Creyke Rd it started. I remember grinning at the people in the car next to mine, a sort of “oh there’s another wee wobble” conciliatory-type grin, but then it got bad. I had the presence of mind to pull on the hand-brake as my car turned into a mechanical bull. \nThe radio went to static and the traffic lights started to blink yellow. Not-so good, I thought. When it stopped, I moved forward into the intersection and went into shock, covering my face with my hands. It was probably split seconds, but I realised I better pull myself together and move.\nI drove up to the engineering mushroom building (now being demolished) which had people pouring out, and staff marshalling everyone to the playing fields. I talked to a guy who had been working underneath the building. He was ok and we wondered how bad it was. I sat in the car and the radio had come back on, Jim Mora on National Radio was talking to a very shaken reporter in the CBD, saying buildings were down. One of the first things I heard Jim Mora reiterate was that the Ferrymead bridge was down. \n\nSmall boy. Redcliffs.\nI hightailed it out of there, fastest ever trip down Fendalton Rd, but got stuck on Bealey Ave in snarled traffic. My partner works on Bealey, he wasn’t there, had gone to get his daughter, who was at her mum’s due to teacher-only half day. (He had a doctor’s appointment at the Clinic in the CTV building at 12.30 which I hadn’t remembered. By a stroke of fortune he had moved it to 2.30. Sadly, his doctor and many other lovely people didn’t make it out of there). \nAbsolutely stuck in jammed traffic I parked under trees in middle of Ave and ran home to Armagh Street, clutching onto strangers (Kerry? from Contours in town, thank you). Sewage and liquefaction everywhere, Fitzgerald Ave a write off, dazed and confused people, dust smoke and NOISE: sirens, alarms, choppers, rumbling. And more shaking. \nGot home and faced the mess, greeted first by a smashed glass lightshade with some of it still embedded in the ceiling. Fought through the rubble in front of garage door to reach the bikes and leant one to a very frightened girl who had to get back to her parents in New Brighton. Waited an age for partner to get home, then we biked through sludge and broken roads, and what seemed like incessant rumbling to get to Redcliffs. The bridge was passable for pedestrians, but a very quick passage advised. \nThe tide was now far, far out. \n\nFunnily enough I don’t recall thinking tsunami…however the scene on the causeway was straight out of Cormack McCarthy’s ‘The Road’. Low, dark cloud, no one in sight and a shopping trolley abandoned in a hole in the road. Eerie and creepy. But not nearly as shocking as the collapsed cliff behind the school…\nWe eventually got to the preschool, much to the relief of the staff. My son and his best mate had donned high vis vests and firemen’s helmets (ahead of the fashion trend) from dress-ups and were calming the little kids with feats of bravery and peek-a-boo. The best mate’s mum had only just managed to make it from town then too, with the front of her car stoved in from bricks, so really it’s lucky she made it at all. It was now around 5.30, time had just flown. One of the staff thankfully let us borrow her car as she was too terrified to drive. The idea of biking back to Linwood with my son on the back and liquefaction/sewage spraying up didn’t appeal. Thanks Letisha! Took about an hour to drive home via Heathcote (under the damaged rail overbridge with the train stopped on it) and passed the stadium which looked like no place for a rugby world cup semi-final. \nThank you to all the help from far and wide; USAR, police, CD, Red Cross, Salvation Army; dog teams; ambulance officers; food bearers etc etc etc. And to everyone in Christchurch that day and since. \nHasn’t it been a year eh?",

Everyone was bent over and flopping about. I was facing the windows and it looked suddenly different outside but I couldn’t comprehend why. People moved to the exits without panicking. A man close to me was looking for his wife who had gone to the toilets on the first floor. I wanted to go up to find her but both escalators were full of people coming down. His wife appeared. We were gathering out on the riverbank across the road and that was were the jitters set in for me. \nA woman I was with was crying and distressed. Her husband was out of town and she had no way to contact him. I gave her my phone to contact her daughter. Sirens were sounding continuously. Huge windows had fallen from the building across at the corner and the river was rising rapidly as we watched. People were franticly texting family and friends. We were getting big aftershocks and the river kept rising. The old stone Provincial Chambers across the river collapsed. The riverbank was shaking. It was all new. We were realizing we still had belongings inside the library and were not going to be able to get keys and wallets and phones, and that our cars would have to be left in town. We had no idea of what was happening in the rest of the city centre. The Central Library is somewhat on the edge of the CBD. \nI couldn’t remember how to use my phone properly I was so jittery. I didn’t get many texts through. I couldn’t get my daughter in the suburbs at all. Later got some of my family. My bike was locked in the stands out the front of the library and my bike-lock, bag, jackets, wallet and keys were all in my locker in a back room of the library. I started walking home knowing I didn’t even have a house key or car key with me, and hoping I had one hidden outside. Passed the new Council Buildings standing strong but with huge windows out. Passed the Arts Centre with huge damage. The museum looked OK. Now in a stream of people heading home on foot. Civilian cars sounding sirens were heading towards the hospital. A crowd of people out on the riverbank behind the hospital – many wrapped in white sheets. Over the damaged bridge by the boatsheds and out into liquefaction territory from there the whole length of Antigua Street. Wet sloppy silt that seemed to come from nowhere and was everywhere underfoot. Very surreal. \nStill couldn’t make contact with my daughter. Traffic so thick along Morehouse Ave and no traffic lights working. People doing their best to direct traffic and keep it moving. Managing to avoid getting my feet too mucky. Now walking with a woman and her little dog. She had come from the city centre and her family’s jewelry store which had been damaged by the building next to it. She was walking her dog all the way home across town to check on her grandmother. Suddenly out of the liquefaction so thinking this side of town maybe unaffected. Later found out that was wrong. Still never imagining what destruction this had set off in the inner city and beyond. My house feared pretty well. Cupboard doors all open in the kitchen but nothing on the floor. Spare room messy with shelving and contents fallen over. My little street seemed safe again. My neighbour was cleaning up messes off the floor but OK. Walked several suburbs to check on my daughter who was thankfully safe. More violent shakes. Daughter very calm. News coming in from family that we were all accounted for and safe. No power, no water, no sewerage system. \nThis was big. But we still didn’t know how devastating it had been. My power came back on at about 8 pm and water on Sunday. \nWe had many powerful shocks through the night and into the morning. I sat up in a doorway close to my front door with cushions and duvet and stayed there until morning. Talked for ages with my daughter overseas who was planning to travel to Christchurch with her baby in 5 weeks time. Sat up listening to the now famous and comforting Meridian transistor with my light on not lying down to sleep until around 3 in the morning. Powerful aftershocks still coming.\nIt all seemed so unbelievable… and yet just the beginning.",

        "text": "It’s a day like any other day.  We have been out, collected my daughter from kindergarten, bought some lunch and headed home to a friend’s house.  It’s not a warm day so we are happy to be inside, huddled today around the dining room table putting stitches of love into a gift for a friend whose baby is due any day now.  We talk, we laugh, we work steadily.  My daughter sits in the middle of the lounge beside us playing with some Little People.\nThe first warning sign is the noise, the rumble of an approaching earthquake, but this is nothing unusual.  We look up, ears straining to hear if it’s going to be a ‘decent’ one this time.  Like meercats we always pop to alert when the rumble starts, but nothing today suggests this will be any different to any of the other aftershocks we’ve felt.  The shaking starts and for a second I think it’s okay, it’ll just stop like all the others have.  Then I look over at my daughter and see lego sculptures falling off the bookcase and smashing around her and the TV rocking backwards and forwards behind her.  Instinct kicks in and I run towards her.  By now the shaking is so intense we can hardly stand.  My friend reaches my daughter first and we head towards the doorway.  We struggle to open the wooden sliding door which leads  to the porch and freedom from the now-oppressive house.  For one horrifying moment it feels like we are airborne then we all smash through the door, taking it off its hinges and landing in a jumble of bodies.  My daughter’s fragile body is on the bottom of the pile and there is enough time for my heart to clench with desperate fear, and the fervent hope that she’s okay before she makes a sound.  We grab her and crawl through the doorway to the safety outside.\nI can’t tell if it’s over and the shaking I now feel is from an aftershock or if it’s still going.  Twenty five seconds doesn’t seem long enough, yet they say it only lasts that long.  I stare at the small cracks that have appeared in the lawn as we sit huddled together, struggling against the tears that are threatening.  I don’t want to cry, don’t want my daughter to worry any more than she already is.  She is pale and uncharacteristically quiet and I don’t want to burden her any more.  ‘It’s okay’ I say over and over again, smoothing her hair back, hoping that if I say it often enough it’ll become the truth.  She nods, but her gaze is fixed on the ground which is still tossing restlessly underneath us.  She doesn’t believe me.  Who can blame her? I don’t believe me either.\nWhen it’s over we decide to go and pick up our other children from school.  My friend’s driveway is torn up, the end of it barely passable, but the area around it is an oasis of calm.  Once away from my friend’s house it looks like nothing has happened.  ‘Was that right under my house?’ she wonders as we drive out into unaffected streets.  We start to feel a little silly, rushing off to check on our kids when it obviously wasn’t very bad.  Then we turn a corner and are confronted with chaos – there is a large crack running right across the road and water has started to pour out into the street.  Still thinking it may have been close by we go another street over hoping it will be less affected.  It’s worse.  We drive it anyway, now desperate to get our other children.  \nBy the time we get to the school we are in ankle deep water and have had to weave around several sink holes, some of which have cars in them – fallen in there and abandoned.  I find a park outside the school.  The children are all on the field and my clearest impression is of a fountain of water gushing out of a great gash in the grass.  My kids are somewhere on the other side of that gash, indistinguishable from the other children from this distance.  My friend goes to get the others while I stay in the car with my daughter.  She’s gone only a second when the car jolts alarmingly and the eerie sound of children screaming drifts across the field to me.  The sound is piercing and I know already that I’ll never forget it, never forget the terror in those voices.  Eventually my friend returns with our children.  They are usually strong, happy boys but today they look small, fragile and worried.  One is in tears and explains how his classroom had cracked around them as they tried to get out.\nI drive off, trying to avoid the deepest parts of the water in the street, but as we approach the corner we are warned there is a large hole around there and no way to get past it.  I try to turn.  The car’s wheels spin and mud flies up.  I open the door to look out – there is water right up to the base of the car.  It’s immediately obvious that I can neither get out of the car that way nor drive the car – we have fallen into another, smaller hole.  Smaller, but no less effective.  I climb out the passenger side and we hand the kids out into the middle of the road.  For some reason I have taken my shoes off.  They are my favourite pair and I don’t want to get them wet or dirty.  In retrospect it seems foolish but right in that moment I feel I have to be barefoot.  It becomes clear that the water in the road isn’t water – it’s liquefied silt and it’s starting to solidify.\nWe plod home, avoiding the silt as much as we can though there are places where it’s unavoidable and we have to make a human chain passing the children from one to the other of us just to get them through the deepest of the sludge.  The walk normally takes around fifteen minutes, but today it’s closer to forty minutes.  We meet people on the walk home: stressed people, helpful people, scared people.  We talk, we share radios, we hear of deaths.  We live through a surreal moment when the people on the radio discuss an earthquake and it reaches us several seconds later.  Through it all we worry.  I had heard from my husband shortly after the quake but all contact was lost soon after.  My friend hasn’t heard from hers at all.  Until both are safe and sound back home neither of us can relax.  They arrive, one after the other, several hours later.  The relief is instantaneous – the fear clutched around my heart lessens a little.\nWe have no power, no water, no sewerage so we sit with battery powered radios and cellphones trying to come to grips with the enormity of what is happening.  Eventually my mother comes – she wants us to stay with her and my father.  They have power.  They have water.   They have sewerage.  It’s an easy choice even though part of me feels like I’m abandoning my area, my friends, my community.  I have a need to know what happened, to see it so we watch the news on TV and I almost wish I was back home.  Nothing I imagined from what I heard on the radio prepared me for the reality of what I see on the TV.  \nIt is over a week before I spend more than a few minutes at home – more than a week before we get water and power back on.  More than a week before we return home and I have my own things around me again.  More than a week before we stop merely existing and start trying to live.",

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with John Cleaver conducted shortly after the 22 February 2011 earthquake.\nMy name is John Cleaver, I am 83, and I was just at home, in the kitchen actually. I always have a cooked meal at midday and I was just about to put my lunch in the microwave to get it all warmed up and the whole place just shook. It was the end it, I didn’t get my warm lunch, and I thought gosh, that was very inconvenient of the earthquake, if it would have just waited five minutes I would have had a warm meal! So I just stood there and hung onto the bench till everything sort of calmed down. \nBut I had quite a lot of crystal, very nice crystal, mainly French in the cupboard there, and that all came down and smashed on the floor.  Apart from that, nothing really happened to the house. All the books fell out of the bookcase downstairs. It was quite interesting really, I felt all right, but I couldn’t have been really because it was a couple of days and I was still looking at that heap of broken glass on the floor and also the books. I just couldn’t do it somehow.\nAnd anyway, my dear grandson Jacob, he came around, just at the right time as he often does, and he cleaned the whole floor up, vaccuumed and taped up the cupboards and did all those sorts of things. I still couldn’t do the books, but the lady from next door came in and she put the books back. I felt all right, you know, but I was still in a certain amount of shock without realising it.   \nI can’t remember what I did after the shaking stopped… I had to have a cold lunch…I really can’t think what I did… I think I just treated it as a normal day really. The severe aftershocks don’t worry me very much really, they are very, very similar to what happens at sea really, in rough weather. \nIn the next few days I just behaved normally really. I belong to quite a few organisations, there is always paper work to be done, so thats what I probably did.\nImmediately after the earthquake a lot of people came around to see whether I was all right and after a few days I think the Red Cross came, checking up on all the elderly, but unfortunately I don’t feel very elderly, but I suppose I am. Yes, so that was all very nice.\nI didn’t really feel as if I did as much as I should have done to help other people. I didn’t offer any accommodation, which I could have done really, in hindsight. Perhaps I should have done more things like that. I did deliver a few meals, when the Navy was here cooking all those meals I delivered some of them, so that was something.\nMy niece rang up from Nelson and said “John, do you want to come up here?’, but I couldn’t. Quite apart from the responsibilities I’ve got, I just didn’t want to be away, I wanted to be here. \nI don’t think I could have happily left, I had a look around at all my buildings, which is the Torpedo Museum, which is in perfect order. I had a look at the [Freemason’s] Lodge, which was further damaged, and started to work on getting that propped up, because we are still hoping to restore it. I also had a look at the [old Lyttelton jail ] cells, and they are perfectly all right. Margaret Copeland put up a display in there and it didn’t even fall over! And as far as the Torpedo Museum goes, that building was built as a magazine to withstand an explosion, so that’s why it was perfectly all right.  \nBut I’m afraid the Lodge, well, half of the lodge is double-brick and the other part is wooden, the wooden section is actually younger than the other section strangely enough. But the brick section has been quite badly damaged, the wooden section is more or less all right.  \nI had quite a few phone call because I have quite a lot of family in the area. \nAs we all know the earthquake has reenforced the community feeling. I enjoyed the party down at the Grassy [Lyttelton Main School Playground], it was the first event that we had that the rest of Christchurch was excluded from (laughs), so that was quite interesting. That was very nice. It takes me back to when we first came here in 1956; it was a totally enclosed, totally self-sufficient community. We had all the shops you could possibly think of here, and our only connection with Christchurch was the half hourly train service. So the earthquake was a reminiscence of those early days. \nI can remember when we had three little kids, we didn’t have a car, my wife wheeled them down the street with the pram to do all our shopping at all the different shops and get a taxi home. We had 4 taxis in Lyttelton and all the stuff got delivered. That was a good system. And, that will never happen again, there were 2000 people working on the water front, so a large proportion of the population worked together. We had big families, they would all go to the three schools. We had the three churches which were more patronised in those days, we even had a maternity hospital. So when the tunnel went through it has changed things quite a lot. I think the geography of a place helps a lot, it keeps us together. It’s one of the few places really, most of the Christchurch suburbs are not well defined at all.\nI am part of the whanau round in Rapaki, I’ve got lots of family connections with them, and I was trying to ring Christine, who is my… great-grandson’s auntie. I couldn’t get her all day, so I went around there about 6 o’clock, I got invited in immediately, it was meal-time, so I got kai. So I said, ‘Look, I didn’t come around for a meal, I came around to see how you all are.’ And of course Christine had been doing good Samaritan work the whole day, that’s why I couldn’t get hold of her, which she does all the time. Although she is blonde, and comes from Sydney, she really fits in, I think she has been here for 14 years. I was quite impressed, because Doug Couch for example, his house had just been totally destroyed  and his wife had a narrow experience with boulders coming down the hill and he was quite cheerful and everyone was. It just shows how in a close community like Rapaki you support one another, in Lyttelton as well, but Rapaki is smaller and one big family really.\nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton.  We are very grateful to Bettina and the interviewees for allowing their interview transcripts to be posted on QuakeStories.",

        "text": "I remember pulling the curtains on the the 22nd February and thinking it was a very strange light outside that morning. My husband left early to go to Wellington to work for 3 days. I was going to go to the Palms shopping mall to have lunch but because it was a dull day I decided to stay home. I was watching Joyce Meyer on television when I heard a loud rumbling noise and my chair started to move and I could feel the floor moving under my feet. The entertainment unit was moving about a foot out from the wall on one side then it would go back and the other side would move about a foot out from the wall. It took a while to register it was an earthquake. The pictures on the walls all began to move and fall and I could hear things breaking.\nWhen the shaking stopped I had a quick look through the house and saw the contents of my pantry, fridge and crockery cupboards all spewed out all over the kitchen floor. What an awful mess it made. My bedroom door had shut and I could not open it as the snib had buckled. Unfortunately our transistor radio was in there so I couldnt get to it. All the books had fallen off the shelves in my husbands study, and 2 big filing cabinets had tipped over.\nI thought of my elderly neighbour and decided to go and check on her, but my doors were locked and I couldn’t get them open. I managed to get out the ranch slider by lifting the door up and it seemed to unlock and slide. My neighbour was frightened but glad to see me and I suggested we go outside in case there was an aftershock. We stood in her driveway and all the neighbours came running over. They were all upset at the things they had lost and I reminded them it was just stuff and at least we were all still alive. We had no idea of the devastation and loss of lives in our city. While standing outside we saw muddy water coming around the side of the house and then we became aware of liquefaction in our street.\nMy husband phoned from Wellington and he told me the top had come off the cathedral and he also said the quake was 6.3. My response was “rubbish” as it felt so much stronger than the 7.1 quake in September. A neighbour came over and helped get my bedroom door open which was great as I could see liquifaction coming from behind my bedroom outside and I was afraid it might be going inside.\nMy son was at University when the earthquake struck. He went to catch a bus home but saw it almost tip over with an aftershock, so decided to walk back to his flat in Lincoln Road. He checked his flat then biked across town through water and sewage to be with me. He stayed with me, however, I didn’t get much sleep as there were aftershocks all through the night.\n\nMy husband managed to get a flight home on the Wednesday afternoon. We had no power, water or sewage for 16 days. My cell phone went flat and I had no way of charging it. People were trying to ring me but not getting through. After a few days we were able to use a plug in phone at times. We chose to stay at home and we managed very well. We had a generator lent to us which was a real help. We also purchased a chemical toilet which made life much easier. We were delighted when an army of students arrived to help shovel silt on the Thursday. They worked very hard and did such a great job. On Friday and Saturday nights a helicopter flew into our local park and hot meals and drinking water were delivered to us in wheelbarrows. Tankers of water were brought into our area and we could go and fill our own containers. An elderly man bought a box of groceries to us which included muesli, easy to make meals, fresh fruit and vegetables, drinking water, toilet paper, rubber gloves, and hand sanitiser.\nOur roads looked like 4 wheel drive tracks but people worked very long hours and already they are much improved. A lot of people left our area but those of us who stayed looked after one another. My husband made a shower out of a large plastic bottle and it worked very well. We would fill it with water and hang it in our shower cubicle and it gave us a 3 minute shower which was great. It was several days before we got to see any TV coverage of the earthquake. Our house has some nasty cracks but we are hoping it can be fixed.   \nWe really appreciate all the kindness shown to us in the days following the earthquake.\n\nWe have since found out that our home is in the red zone so we are going to have to look for a new house to make into our home.",

        "text": "I walked up St Andrew’s Hill in Christchurch.  There was a small quake, and a woman tending her garden and I held on to her fence for a bit, waiting for it to pass.\n\n“Are you leaving Christchurch this weekend?” she asked.\n\n“No, is there a reason why I should?”.\n\n“Lots of people are getting away to miss the big quake” she said.\n\n“What big quake?”\n\n“The one Ken Ring predicted.  It’s all to do with the tides, you see”.\n\n“Ken Ring.  Oh yes – the Moon man.  He is the one that a year’s predicts each day’s weather over the course of a year based on the tides.  Because the Moon’s gravity pulls the tides he thinks that affects the weather”.\n\n“I don’t know about that.  But what he says is that a full moon pulls the earth’s crust, like it pulls the tides, and that will create a Mag. 4 earthquake about noon.” she said.\n\nShe goes on to say that Ken Ring has predicted that there will be a Christchurch (or maybe Marlborough) quake of Magnitude 4 by noon on 20 March 2011.  Mr Ring is not very clear about where the predicted earthquake will occur.  \n\n“I’m not planning to go anywhere.” I said “Are you?”\n\n“Oh yes. We’re heading to Timaru. I’m tired of quakes” she said.\nPeople are not thinking rationally.  They want certainty in their life.  Scientists are giving probabilities and Mr Ring is giving certainties.\nThe moon’s gravity pulls the oceans to make the tides.  Mr Ring says that when the moon is closer to the earth it exerts a stronger pull so it can move the earth’s crust.  That’s pretty good going as the crust is pretty thick, and gravity is very weak.  Gravity is weaker than me as I can lift my leg off the ground and it doesn’t take much effort at all.  To think that something weaker than me lifting my leg can shift an entire tectonic plate underlying New Zealand is quite extra-ordinary.  \nWhen the moon is closer than usual it looks bigger and is called a super moon.  Since there may be 1-6 super moons per year, it’s amazing that the stronger gravity hasn’t caused earthquakes at the same time as a super moon before now.  Apparently it has taken careful study by Mr Ring who has just figured it out right now.  \nI listen to the radio.  Mr Ring is saying that he had predicted the February earthquakes too.  People are calling in pretty upset, telling him to think of the lives that would have been saved if he had actually made the prediction prior to the earthquakes. Others are amazed at how powerful his predictions are, and are buying his books.\nScientists on the radio say that the chance of a mag 4 earthquake on the date Mr Ring predicted is quite high, as we have just had larger earthquakes.  That chance is high for the day before and the day after, and the week after and the month after that too.  To be as precise as Mr Ring says and be correct is like flipping a coin.  Chances are 50:50 he will have a lucky guess.\nSomewhere between 500 and 50,000 people depending on the news articles you read believe Ken Ring and flee Christchurch.  Many head for Twizel where, ironically, there are three earthquakes over magnitude 4 that Mr Ring did not predict happen around 1:30pm.  \nThe predicted noon Christchurch quake does not happen. Instead a 5.1 hits around 9:47pm at night.  \nAfter the predicted event, John Campbell, a journalist, interviews Mr Moon on radio.  Mr Moon alters his story to suit the facts.  Mr Campbell treats him seriously, and becomes a tiny bit frustrated by the half truths.  Unfortunately, this comes across as not suffering fools lightly, for which Mr Campbell later apologises.  Consequently, some people have empathy for Mr Ring, and this clouds their judgement of the severity of the situation he incited.\nPeople who left Christchurch o avoid earthquakes are very upset with Mr Ring. He receives a number of death threats, and goes into hiding for two years.  By 2014 he was back predicting moon weather and moon quakes again, and people were buying his books again.",

        "text": "23 February  Tuesday night was a sleepless one.  Though we’d gone to bed at around dark-thirty, we’d not slept very well at all.  I was not awakened even once with the aftershocks from the 4 September quake, though I felt plenty enough of ‘em during the day and evening.  This time, however, I found it difficult to sleep, and every time I nearly succeeded, I was jolted awake again.  \nSo, I awoke on Wednesday quite tired, but ready for work around 7am.  It’s pretty easy to get ready for work when all you have to do is get up and get changed.  No shower, no breakfast, nothing.  For a moment, I forgot to put my shoes on, and was horrified when I realised I had walked across the hallway to the spare bedroom in my bare feet.  With all the glass that has shattered in our home, I reckon it’ll be months before we’re able to do that without running the risk of impaling ourselves with a sliver of glass.  I carefully backtracked and slipped into my sandals.\nMy husband stayed home to do a tidy-up, and my plan was to go in for a couple or three hours and then come back.  I ended up staying practically all day.\nFortunately, I did not have to cross the hill, as the turn-off to Heathcote (just before the closed Ferry Road bridge) was allowing traffic.  I scooted over to Brougham and headed toward the motorway, happy that I’d left home early enough to avoid the miles-long traffic jams that are normally so alien to my adopted city.  As I passed the petrol station on the opposite side of the 4-lane road, I decided I couldn’t be bothered doing a U-turn; that would be the shortest line I would see at a petrol station for the next few days at least, and I later regretted not stopping.\nI learned that our brand-new office in town had been damaged, or at least the details of it, but maybe I had heard the rumblings of that the day before.  Anyway, in brief, we had just moved into a lovely building adjacent to the Smith City carpark.  We’d been there about a month, and I loved the location, the open plan, the many meeting rooms, and the availability of ‘hot desks’ (computers) for staff who wanted to do some work from there.  I’d spent all day Friday there, and all day Monday there, and had parked my car in the visitor’s carpark space both days; during Tuesday’s quake, the car in that space ended up at the receptionist’s desk inside our office.  The carpark pancaked and slid into the office building.  Fortunately, noone was badly hurt.\nThe next concern for our organisation is, our server was located inside that building, and we had no real idea how much time we had before it failed.  With our server down, every employee would be unable to access basic files and information, including emails.  We got to work spreading personal email addresses, in order to allow communications to continue when the inevitable happened.  We also did a quick calculation of hours worked and submitted them to an external person in another city in order to ensure staff wages were ready on time.\nFortunately, the electricity at our workplace had come back on the night before, and we also had water; I think at this stage something like 50% of the city still had no power, and 80% were without water.  As before, all water from the taps had to be boiled, and everyone was asked to refrain from flushing toilets or using showers, as the strain on the system might be too much, and, to be a bit graphic, noone was sure where anything you flushed might pop up.\nSadly, the sewage was diverted again straight into the river and oceans; they were just coming right from the last quake, although people were still urged to avoid most bodies of water after any rainfall, which tended to wash pollution back into them.  Still, those with water and power and flushing toilets felt very blessed – and probably a bit guilty, as well.  \nI sent a staff member to one of the very few open grocery stores to buy a few items which we knew, from experience, would disappear quickly from the shelves.  Bread, water, milk.  Simple items to cook on the BBQ (just because they had power, didn’t mean they wouldn’t lose it).  The staff member finally found an open store and stood in line for a good hour to pay for her purchases.  Another staff member attempted to fill the vehicle with petrol, amid reports of it sometimes taking 3 hours to get through queues.  Damn!  I should have stopped that morning, as my own vehicle was running quite low with the extra-long trips to and from home.\nFinally, I was able to leave work after about 7 hours.  This time, I had a roadmap with me, and as soon as I came upon stopped cars, I would weave my way down another road, and then another.  I went well out of my way, again ending up on Centaurus, but I travelled more quickly than I would have by staying in the miles-long queues.  Often, I would be travelling in a relatively low-traffic direction, but would pass mile after mile of vehicles going in the other direction, stopped, barely inching forward.\nThe queues at the few open petrol stations were staggeringly long as well, and I decided to wait until Thursday morning to attempt to get into a station before the masses awoke.\nTo be honest, Wednesday and Thursday are starting to meld together already.  I can hardly remember with certainty what things happened which day.  I think it was Thursday that I drove past Peacocks Gallop and saw dog handlers searching the rubble for signs of life, but it may have been Wednesday.\nHome again.  We had tuna with a packet of instant noodles.  Again, I just didn’t have an appetite, and barely ate anything at all.  It was our second night without electricity, and we were hearing reports that it could be several weeks, possibly a month or longer, before we would get it.\nOur constant companion at home was the transistor radio which we had tuned to a station which was all news, all the time.  Sadly, it was the same news, much of the time.  News items would be repeated ad nauseum.  The body count kept rising.\nWe finally moved the dial a bit and found another station which was more about having people call in, and that was far more heartening as caller after caller requested help with something or offered help to whoever needed it.  People offered water and food, places to charge cell phones, places to keep pets, places to stay.  If you didn’t have something, and needed it, you’d soon have it.  The way people have pulled together – again – has been inspiring.\nBack to bed around dark-thirty, but it was another sleepless night with continued, strong aftershocks.",

        "text": "“Wake up! Wake up! earthquake EARTHQUAKE!” My dad shouted at me as he shaked me awake. Wearily, I opened my eyes. Darkness was what I saw, but then I realised that it wasn’t my dad who was shaking me awake. Furniture rattled as I heard a deep rumbling sound coming from the ground. At first, I was confused. Why are my parents yelling at me to get up? Back then, I never realised how serious the situation actually was. In my 7 year old mind, it was just the ground shaking. \nI went down the stairs wearily and turned on the lights. Only when I realised that no lights light up did I actually panic. My grandparents were up as well and we all quickly got into the car as the ground shook.\nMy memory was a bit fuzzy, but I remember that we immediately got into the car right outside. After a while, everything went silent. I may be wrong, but I think that it was a Friday when this happened. That meant I had violin the next morning.  Mum went back into the house to get some socks but she had to be quick in case it might quake again. \nAs I waited, I asked my dad what happened. He replied that an earthquake had occurred and that it’s not safe to go back into the house since the house may fall on top of us even though it seemed to be perfectly fine. In the end, mum came back with her socks since she cannot find mine in the dark.\nFor the rest of the night, we sat there trying to sleep on the upright seats in the car. In the end, we never actually fell asleep, possibly because of our weird sleeping position. Until the night turned into day, whenever there were some more aftershocks I would yell: “earthquake! go away!” It may be a coincidence but it seemed to work- most of the time, that is.\nWhen morning came, we drove to my violin place, which was an old building sort of similar to a church. As we got there, I saw that there were some buildings that once stood so tall collapsed and white rubble almost everywhere. That’s strange, I thought. When we got there, we found that the building collapsed into rubble. A man in an orange baseball cap was looking around the shattered foundation. I was confused as I also thought about the other buildings. How can a shaking ground cause such strong building to collapse? In the end we drove back home.\nFrom then on,  I suddenly understood that earthquakes are a powerful force capable of tearing down the strongest of architecture. Never did I realise then that the earthquake would change the history of Christchurch forever.",

        "text": "Quake story – not a bad ending\nHi I’m in Christchurch, New Zealand, and I thought I’d write my quake-story since I’m in bed with chest-trouble and can’t get up and work yet.\nOn the 22nd of February I’m walking up Richmond hill on the road above Sumner with a backpack of stuff to drop off at a friend’s there. Suddenly there’s a roaring and banging and the ground’s reverberating me like rice on a drum-skin. I run from the drop edge of the road to the other side all over the place like a drunk on roller-skates (you can laugh) – lucky there are no cars, because I have little control over the direction. I want to grab a sapling at the bank on that side, as it’s supple and might not rip out, while a large tree might crush me. I watch for the bank itself collapsing over me.\n\nIt does collapse, eventually.\nI hear a man howling and roaring, but he stops and I don’t know where the noise comes from of all the houses either side. I decide I won’t enter any houses as my priority’s securing my own children, and who knows what’ll happen next. The shaking stops, and I cell-phone-text my daughter who’s at my house about 4km away, with her 7-day-old daughter. “I’m O.K. You O.K?” No message passed then after a few minutes, “We O.K. You O.K?” “Yes; coming home now” No voice-calls for a while.\nAbout 2 minutes after the big shake, another one and I scream. I won’t say I wet myself because that happened when I jumped the first time, being older and the pack being heavy. Black trousers are good. Some work-men come down the hill, and I see my big chance, girls! (just joking) I say “Is it O.K if I have a hug?” and he grins very kindly and holds out his arms. Boy; I clutch that big bloke in a death-grip and shake like a jelly, and hope he can’t detect urine-fumes. I tell him I heard a man screaming but don’t know where from.\nJogging on down the hill and see that this is a serious historic quake, as stuff’s shattered all over the place and below the houses a garage-sized boulder has bashed-in the Returned Services Building.\nI cuddle an old lady with a bloodied tea-towel around her head sitting outside her house, but have to get on home to protect my family, and continue jogging. On the causeway I keep an eye out for tsunamis, deciding to swarm up the nearest tree if I see one, or the tide rush out, and the asphalt gives underfoot here and there, so I wonder whether I might plummet through like quicksand. It would’ve been spews of liquefaction. Cars are leaving in droves (excuse the pun!) and in about 20 minutes, people are coming in from the other direction in cars and by foot in business-suits with the trousers rolled up as the bridge has been closed for a while. Lots of people offer me a ride, but I prefer to be on my own resources as there are tumbled cliffs and buildings and prospects of more to come, of course.\nOnce I’m past them, I get a ride from some sweet teenagers. The lad’s so upset, he drives up and over the median grass to put me at my street and get to his own home, which is nearby. The sewer’s burst, and liquid’s pouring across the road – where the hell’s my house? Oh – the chimney’s down; that’s why I can’t spot it from a distance. My daughter and her old childhood friend are crouched in the wooden hallway with the baby and the friend’s toddler in their arms, under the big braced arch near the glass front door at the veranda, staring at me with the big eyes.\nBaby’s fine and breast-feeding up a storm. My daughter was opening the fridge, and the lathe and plaster ceiling ripped out a big chunk and bounced off the top of its open door, shattering. She’s not bruised. She runs to baby and finds baby’s O.K. and sound asleep. The huge flat-screen TV catapulted across the room as the chest of drawers tipped over and it’s scythed down between her bassinet and the double bed. The mobile fastened onto the foot of the bassinet has stopped the drawers which’ve slid out from touching her, as it’s braced against the heavy chest of drawers.\nBoy; am I wired!!! I rush about joking and tidying the kitchen where the fridge and cupboards have toppled the contents, and the other messes, including my soaked bed from overflow into the ceiling, and get onto the roof during after-shocks (yay! funsies!) to smash the bricks apart and toss them into the garden as the 2.5m stack of brick’s above the living-room and the new steel roof’s dipped. My daughter comes out scandalized at my 60-yr-old’s risk-taking behaviour and nags me to come down. Wee t*t-limpet keeps chomping away at the breast, blissfully regardless. Later on I’ll discover two rafters are snapped. While I’m up on the roof, I spy a neighbour coming in with a shopping-trolly to steal from me. I find out a lot about peoples’ character in the days to come.\nWater’s sloshed out of the toilet cisterns, but the floor’s not particle-board so it’s o.k. The power’s off, so I build a barbeque from some of my bricks, and collect dead-wood and pine-cones from the local park. We get the power and water on and off for a while, and I regretfully toss-out the freezer-full of cheap chicken my son got me on his student holiday job. The storm-water drain and house pipes are broken under the ground and there’s several months to wait before the s.w drains can be fixed.\nMy big sister’s house has a twist and 60cm tilt from front to back and widening cracks. The internal garage-wall on the little sister’s house has tumbled. The two brothers’ places here are pretty o.k. The first lighter quake in September last year’s broken 9 concrete piles, so there’ll be more this time. My sister tells me “Hey; your mantelpiece’s on a tilt” I reply “la-la-la” and stick my fingers in my ears …",

She was fully clothed and asked me if I could go home, pick up some dry clothes and drop them to her so that she could teach her next class at 1pm.\nI was due to hold a meeting with my sales staff at 1pm but agreed to do this.

The roads and bridges that I drove down and crossed were later closed because of extreme damage and liquification. The adreneline rush was such that I didn’t notice how bad they were. On reaching QE11 I found my wife in the outside park marshalling over 250 children who had been in the pools that day. All were wet, cold and in some cases, histerical.

        "text": "I wrote this in the days following the 22 February quake.  We really thought we had dodged a bullet.\nWhen we were shaken from our beds at 435am on 4 September, 2010, shock that ‘the big one’ had hit Christchurch rather than Wellington turned to relief that we had gotten through without loss of life.\nOur sadness over lost or damaged buildings was bookended by happiness that so much was still standing and that so much could be and would be rebuilt, regardless of cost.\nThe next phase was probably one of fatigue, as thousands of aftershocks rattled our homes and our nerves, til finally we became ‘experts’ and invented our own game of trying to guess how big the most recent quake was, before it was posted on Geonet.  Most of us got pretty good at it, pretty quickly.\nImmediately following the 7.1 in September, we were told that there is normally an aftershock within weeks which is about 1M smaller than the initial quake, but as time passed, it seemed less likely, and for the most part, we had settled into a bit of complacency about the aftershocks.\nSince the Boxing Day (26 December) quake which rattled the central city, the aftershocks had mostly disappeared, even, and life was returning to ‘a new normal’, with some buildings still cordoned off, an increasing number of vacant lots, and a lot of new scaffolding.\nWe really thought we had come through it, and that any future aftershocks would be smaller and less frequent, til finally they were gone.\nAnd then….\nOn Tuesday 22 February, traffic was backed up for miles on Sumner’s main route to the city.  My husband even texted me to say that I should take the road up Sumner valley to Evans Pass, down to Lyttleton, and through the tunnel to the city.  That drive, though longer, takes only about five minutes longer to travel, and when traffic is backed-up nearly to Shag Rock, as it was that morning, it is often much faster to drive over the hill and through the tunnel.\nBut, I needed petrol, so I had to battle the traffic.\nFinally arriving in the city, I stopped at our office and then ran errands, looking for a storage shed, grabbing breakfast along the way.  I was about to stop for some takeaway lunch to take back to my workplace when I got a call that I was needed urgently.  I arrived at my workplace, and as a colleague, the client, and I walked back onto our driveway, the quake hit.\nThe long driveway is wide enough for a single car, and is bordered on each side by tall wooden fences.  The neighbour had just climbed upon the fence to talk to us when the quake hit.  It was impossible to stand upright, and almost impossible to keep on my feet.  The neighbour must have had one helluva ride, and must have been hanging on for dear life; when the quake subsided many long lifetimes later, we shook hands and introduced ourselves properly, for the moment having forgotten any differences.\nWe knew right away that this was no normal aftershock.  As I’ve written above, having now lived through thousands of these things, we could now come pretty close to correctly guessing the magnitude of the quakes, and immediately knew that this had to be the sixer we’d been warned about since September, but which we had thought by now we must have dodged.\nStaff and clients who were inside the house, ran outside, and as a group we watched the traffic come to a halt.  Without electricity, horns were blaring as cars started-and-stopped their way through the intersection.  Two of my teenaged clients were adamant about wanting to go out for a walk or a drive, so a lot of effort was spent calming them down and redirecting them.\nI had two staff I needed to track down, but of course cell phones were down (overloaded network).  Texts took at least an hour to travel in one direction, and then an hour or so back, so that suddenly you’d have a dozen texts come in – utterly confusing when they were one-word responses, as well, as you could not recall exactly what the question was.\nWe turned on the car radio and sat there for a while listening, trying to gather news.  We stood by the street watching traffic.  We shook and trembled through several large aftershocks.\nFinally, someone walked by who told us that the epicentre had been in Lyttleton, and I went a bit cold inside.  Lyttelton is literally over the hill from our home – that same short drive I had contemplated taking just that morning; just last year, an entire street in Lyttleton was given historic, protected status; it’s a small harbour town with character.\nSo, for a couple hours, I was in limbo.  I couldn’t contact my husband; although we had a (corded, analog) landline which worked, his workplace had shut up shop shortly after the quake, and he was in the process of spending three hours to do a half-hour trip home.\nAnd, I couldn’t leave.\nI still had two staff and two clients to locate, and I had to make sure everyone was okay.  Two of my staff showed up shortly thereafter, having walked from the local mall where they’d gone to see a movie; both offered to stay and work a shift if required (they were).\nOne staff member and client eventually made their way home by car, reporting that the roads were a mess with traffic lined up for miles.  The other staff member and client were known to be in the central city, and all we could do was wait.\nFinally – finally! – the two of them walked up to the house.  They had been in a video store when the quake hit, and the client had been knocked down by shelves full of videos; people across the street had reportedly not been as lucky, and had been injured.  The staff member and client had spent two hours walking home, and had seen carnage along the way; both are still in a bad state.\nIn the meantime, those of us with analog landlines were busy trying to communicate with other colleagues and teams.  Plans were made to shift people from sites without power/water to other sites.\nFinally, at around 4pm, I braved the traffic for the second time that day and drove onto Blenheim Road. \nAnd stopped.\nTraffic was queued for miles.  It took ages to do a five-minute trip up to a side road where I darted off toward the hills, hoping to find a quicker route.  It was quicker, too, if not completely traffic-free.\nI still had no idea how I was going to get home.  I had heard that the Ferrymead Bridge was out and that the tunnel to Lyttleton was closed, but had had a single text from my husband to say he’d made it home over the hill.  Though it seemed ‘wrong’ somehow, I assumed that he must have meant Evans Pass, the same road I had considered driving that morning.\nIn September, that road had been badly blocked by falling rock – and that was when the quake had been much farther away and a bit deeper in the ground.  How could it be passable this time, when the epicentre was right underneath it?\nI did not have my roadmap, but followed my nose to the end of Colombo Street to the roundabout which led me up the hill toward and over Dyers Pass.  At the top of the pass, I asked army personnel if the road from Lyttleton to Sumner was open, but they didn’t know.  I headed down the hill toward Governor’s Bay.  \nI received a couple more messages from my husband, telling me that the road over Evans Pass was closed, and that I would have to turn around.  His text indicated that I needed to get over Cannon Hill/Mt Pleasant, but as I had never driven that way before, I needed more specific directions.  Still, I headed back over Dyers Pass and back down to the flat, where I wound my way around the bottoms of the hills along Centaurus Road.\nAnd there I began to see the damage.  The road was stuffed, and I had to drive carefully to avoid cracks and holes.  Liquefaction was everywhere.  There was this internal drive telling me I had to get home, to find out what my husband meant when he said the house was wrecked, to make sure my cats were okay, but for the life of me I still didn’t know how I was going to get there.\nIn Heathcote, I passed under a rail bridge where a train sat derailed; that road has since been closed and remains closed, though the train has been removed.  I had once worked at the bottom of Cannon Hill so had no trouble finding it.\nTwice.\nI drove up Cannon Hill, made the correct first turn, then made an incorrect turn and before I knew it I was back at the bottom of Cannon Hill, frustrated as hell.\nI drove up again, and more carefully chose the correct path, and followed it onto Mount Pleasant.  Just last week, we had wanted to cart my visiting family member, Victor, up to the top of this mountain/hill and set him loose on a mountain bike; I did that in 2000 and it was one of the most exhilirating things I’ve ever done.  On this day, too, I was just wanting to get downhill as fast as I could.  It had already been two hours since I’d left work.\nAt the bottom of Mount Pleasant, I turned onto the causeway, and could not believe the level of damage done to this section of road.  It dipped and rose where before it had been flat.  Cracks lined nearly the entire length of the roadway.  Sand volcanoes lined the estuary.\nAnd then in Redcliffs, turning the corner to the afore-mentioned Shag Rock, my heart sank.  Shag Rock had all but fallen, its tall, proud form reduced to rubble.\nMy eyes turned back to the road to avoid falling into the cracks and holes that potmarked the road, but my sadness wasn’t complete.  As I neared Shag Rock and turned that corner, my eyes fell on Peacocks Gallop, the beautiful cliff-side reserve where my husband and I were married.\nThe cliff had fallen, dumping many, many tonnes of rock onto the reserve, and nearly obliterating the rock stack where we’d taken our vows.  Looking up, I could see a swimming pool or patio hanging precariously over the edge.\nI turned toward home, and raced up the hill, not knowing what I would find.  I had to park on the hillside at the end of the drive, as our neighbours’ cars were parked at the end of the drive.  A part of the 100+yo stone wall had fallen, blocking the drive, and I had to clamber over that to get home.\nMy husband was in the carpark and we hugged before I went inside.\nTo the smell of….vinegar.\nI love vinegar, but don’t care if I don’t smell it again for weeks.  At least two bottles of vinegar, along with every other item in our kitchen, was on the floor, broken.  The fridge had emptied its contents, including the banana pudding which I’d made the night before, with Nilla Wafers which Victor had brought to me from the US.  Every dish, every glass, every breakable thing, was broken.\nThe study was in bad shape, too, with nine long shelves and two desks and countless boxes emptied onto the floor.  Had I been home, this is likely where I would have been, and had I thought to get under the desk – not a given, as I tend to not move when an aftershock hits – I would have been stuck under there til my husband got home, as there is little chance I would have been able to dig out beyond the hundreds of paperbacks, the computer monitor, etc.  Had I not gotten under the desk, I would have been absolutely pelted by books, and likely knocked off my seat/feet.\nHowever, had I been home and unhurt, and had I had my wits about me, I joke that I would probably have tried to scoop up any uncontaminated bit of the banana pudding as it’s been years since I had any with Nilla Wafers.\nThe lounge and dining room were a mess as well, and again, everything not on the floor that morning was now on the floor, and if it could break, it pretty much did.  The lounge has another shelf full of books and knick-knacks, and all of that was on the floor – and some of it had somehow found its way downstairs.\nThere was glass everywhere, including the stairwell, where several photo frames had fallen.  The bottom hallway was impassable, as is the spare room where I have boxes of papers and magazines and photos.  The tall chest at one end of the hallway had fallen over, as had mine in our bedroom.  Toilet water had sloshed out of the toilet, wetting the floor and nearby toilet paper.\nWe had no electricity, no water, no sewage, no phone.  The latter returned later that evening, but seemed to drop in and out.\nThe cats had disappeared, and it took quite a good calling to convince them to come out of their hiding places.  One, already shy from having a visitor, was visibly shaken, and refused to come inside the house; the other, once with us, almost refused to leave our sides, and has taken to sleeping with us – or rather, on us, at night.\nIt was now nearly 7pm, and we had a lot to do before dark.\nWe scooped up as much of the kitchen carnage as possible, keeping a few bits and pieces as evidence of breakages.  We put the microwave back on its wall perch, and rejoiced when we found the 3 or 4 pieces that were not broken – a couple glasses, a bowl, a coffee cup.  So much was gone, though, and it was sad to know that all our breakable momentos were gone.\nAnd yet, somehow, the gnome survived.  How does he do it?  The dadgum thing never even fell off his perch, and sits smugly in the highest spot of the kitchen.  My husband has joked that he sits up there with his feet in grime and dust, fairly cemented in place.  It’s that….or perhaps some witchery.\nMentally exhausted, and not knowing where to start, we stopped.  We set up the camp stove, some candles, and foldable chairs outside the back door, and we cooked a simple dinner.  The meat we’d bought the night before had thawed in the hours since the quake (the fridge/freezer doors had come open) so we cooked a couple packages of that, but to be honest, I didn’t have much of an appetite at all, and barely ate anything.\nWe sat in our chairs as dark descended, listening to what would be our lifeline the next few days – the transistor radio.\nAnd when dark came, we went to bed, but not to sleep.  Though the aftershocks following the 7.1 had not awakened me a single time, the ones following this one would barely let me close my eyes.  We slept in our clothing, flashlights at the ready.\nA few long hours later, we awakened to our new reality, all over again.",

        "text": "The Christchurch earthquakes were an earth shattering event in more ways than one. They started a chain of events for the people of Christchurch and indeed the rest of the country; indeed they turned out to be life changing for me. The end of my old life and the beginning of a journey to start a new one. The country as a whole has had to look closely at their buildings, most towns and cities have had some buildings closed as a result. For me the effects of these quakes have been far reaching in fact. The following is a chronology of those effects. I have chosen to write this piece for several reasons. It is a way to get it out of my head; also a way to show others that there is a way through. Christchurch was a stunning place to live, from the iconic Cathedral in the square to the large open space that is Hagley Park. The Avon River meandering its way through the center of town providing a peaceful place for residents and tourists alike to relax and enjoy a more leisurely pace. Its journey ends near New Brighten Beach, which in the summer becomes the people’s playground, the long pier used for fishing and the stretch of unbroken sand beckons to one and all. \n4.30 am on the 4th of September 2010 saw this changed forever; the city and its sleeping residents were awoken from their slumber by one of the most frightening events you can comprehend. Imagine waking up in the dark with all of your senses being bombarded, lots of noise, crashes, bangs and shattering glass, dust in your eyes and mouth. You are being tossed like a salad, up, down and sideways. My first memory of that morning was trying to get out of bed. Every time I rolled over towards my side of the bed I was thrown back into the middle. Finally after what seemed like an eternity, but in reality was only a minute or two, the shaking and the noise stopped. The silence which followed seemed deafening, I lay still, too scared to move in case it started again and yet knowing that I needed to get out of bed to safety. The following is a poem I wrote some six months later as a way to try and get some of the feelings of that day out of my head and on paper. It was written one week prior to the quake which struck on the 22nd of February 2011.\nFour thirty five\n\nI hear a roar, my eyes are open\n\nI see nothing, it’s still dark\n\nThe bed is bucking like a bull\n\nWhere is the floor, I want it to stop\nAll around I hear bangs and crashes\n\nI hope the ceiling stays put, don’t land on me\n\nIt stops, just the sound of my pounding heart\n\nI find the floor, what am I standing on\n\nWhere’s my phone, I need light\nNo power, just an eerie silence\n\nWaiting for daylight to arrive\n\nAnother strong shake, my heart is racing\n\nWe huddle in the lounge as the day lightens\n\nWhat a mess we can see\nGlasses, plates, food, pictures, furniture\n\nSome upended, most just dumped\n\nLots broken, some spilled\n\nNo rhyme or reason to the destruction\n\nWe sit and we wait\nWhere is the cat, is she all right\n\nWhat are we going to do now?\n\nWait for my heart to slow down\n\nMy head to clear, it’s all right my dear\n\nI am here to protect you, hold me\nThere was a real sense of fear and foreboding that morning as the sun came up, no power or phone just silence and the occasional sound of a car going by or the voices of neighbors trying to sort out what was what. We had enough food for a few days; we had a portable gas cooker so that was a start. Around 9am we ventured out to the local shops; mostly to see what was what in our neighborhood. A five minute walk and it was so weird; no damage at all in our neighborhood which was good, the people we met were in various states of shock, as were we. No one seemed to have suffered too badly at all, tales of the odd broken glass or picture was about the worst of it. The local supermarket was a total shambles inside; they had the door open and were selling bread, milk and batteries, cash only and no change. We met a couple who needed some infant formula and had no cash, the EFTPOS system was down so we bought it for them. \nThis was a sobering moment for me, our technology had failed us! I realized that we took so much for granted in our daily lives, how were we going to survive? The next few days were a blur; most of the time we didn’t know which way was up. Conflicting news items and information didn’t help. However the biggest problem was just working out the necessities of daily life, how do you boil enough water to drink; what do you do about the food in the fridge and freezer without any power. How do you wash and probably the most annoying of all, how and where do you go to the toilet. To most of us the inconvenience of having to boil water and having no toilet or power would be bad enough. For a short time it might even be fun to some extent having to get back to basics. If only that was the case for those of us living through this series of events. We had hourly aftershocks to live through and some of those were pretty big ones too. The thing with aftershocks is that you never when the next one will happen, how long it will last or how big it will be. The strain on the nerves just builds and builds to a point where, in my case at least I just wanted the world to stop and let me off. I’d had enough. I was working as a truck driver at the time, long days and hard work; it is real hard to concentrate on that sort of job when half your brain has shut down. \nBy the time of the February 2011 Quake I was pretty much running on auto pilot, I would go to work in the mornings, somehow, muddle thru the day till knock off time and then just die when I got home. My life was just an ever narrowing cycle of days and routines. Work was the only thing that got me out of bed in the mornings but it was getting harder and harder. February came with the promise of something nice and normal in my life, we traveled to Kapiti for my son’s wedding, the 14th of February was the date, it was a fantastic day, and the beginning of better times ahead I told myself. Life was due to turn around, the worst was over, things were picking up at work, and we had water to drink and could use our toilets again. Yes life was looking up all right. \nWe arrived home on the 21st of February, one more free day till I had to go back to work, it rained the morning of the 22nd, by mid morning the day was looking brighter. I was out on the other side of town when the quake hit at 12.51pm that day, a rumble like a truck going by to start with and then all hell broke loose. Standing in the car park of the Shirley Saint Albans club I felt the ground start to move, this was different, this was way worse than any so far. The quake was so severe that I ended up being thrown to the ground, laying there watching the lamp posts bend like grass in the wind, what was coming next. At one point I remember looking towards my car, it was bouncing and jumping so much that I could see daylight under all four wheels. There aren’t words to describe the sight; unless you were there then it’s just too big to put into words. Pure terror comes close though. Having made sure that we were all OK and having checked on the staff in the club, thank god no-one was hurt, if only that had been the case all over town. We all headed home to check on family and friends, no cell phones so it was the best way. The drive across town was quicker than I would have expected, mind you I think that everyone on the roads was trying to do the same thing, no horns or stress, just get home, get safe, find out what mess awaited us. Man what a sight it was, our house and most of our street was untouched, I remember thinking to myself ‘what earthquake’. \nIt was so surreal, quiet and peaceful, no dogs barking just really quiet. Eerie. We opened the front door and oh my god, what a mess, the floor was covered with pictures and books and anything that wasn’t nailed to the walls. The kitchen cupboards were all either empty or totally tossed around, the kitchen floor looked as though there had been a drunken brawl, food, broken plates, jars and glasses everywhere. Where the hell do you start with a mess like that? We didn’t, we cleared a space in the lounge, made a coffee, somehow the TV had survived so we sat and watched the coverage of the quake live as it came in. This was the weirdest time for me, here I was sitting in my lounge, coffee in hand and watching dirty and bloodied people walking the streets, rescuers’ trying to get people out of the broken and twisted remains of buildings. Sirens, cries for help and the almost calm voice of the reporters telling us what was going on. The coverage was that of any natural disaster anywhere in the world and yet it was my city, the streets I drove every day, the buildings I saw all the time, it was only 10 kilometers from my house yet it could have been on the other side of the world. This was the moment when my mind finally shut down and shut off trying to shut out the noise. The sight of broken and battered buildings and people, the screams and cries was all just too much for me. \nThe next clear memory I had was Thursday afternoon, my partner had made an appointment for me at the doctors and I was given some anti depressants and some sleeping pills as well as something to calm me down. Monday morning there was a meeting at my work for all staff, the company I worked for were totally fantastic. We were all going to be paid, we all would have jobs and those of us that needed help just had to ask. There was a Councillor there and I spent some time with her that day and almost daily from then till we left Christchurch. She was good; we talked about lots of things to do with me and what had happened, also how it was affecting my partner. In the end the decision was made that the best thing for us and me in particular was to get away, find somewhere where the ground was more stable and there were people around to support us. We chose Levin, my partner and I had been thinking that a move to the north island would be in our future sometime, however sooner was going to be better than later. \nThe days blurred into weeks, lots of things to do, more support from work, help from the bank too and a lucky break with a truck rental company and all of a sudden the day arrived. The truck was loaded, our lives were packed and all the planning was finished. Thursday the 3rd of March, I made my last trip out to the gate with the rubbish bins, just an ordinary day by the looks of things. The sun was just going down, nice warm breeze and no sign of the strife that had befallen this lovely city. For a brief moment I thought that just maybe this was the wrong thing to do, will I live to regret leaving, who knows. One of my neighbors also was putting her bin out and we exchanged a few words, she was staying, but she understood why we were leaving. It turned out that she was one of the lucky ones, in here words ‘Christchurch rocks my world’. This made me laugh at the irony of the situation; the very thing that was driving me away was making her resolve to stay even stronger. Good. Christchurch needs people to stay and repair and rebuild and carry on, part of me was very happy to know that the city would survive, it will be reborn and rebuilt. Who knows, one day I may go back, even if only for a visit; right now though my focus was on getting back to normal, whatever that is. \nFriday morning and the trip to the North Island begins, I can remember most of it, well as far as getting to Picton at least; from then on it’s pretty foggy as to what happened, I suppose I was running on adrenalin and will power. Auto pilot would be an accurate description. We spent our first night in the north island at my son’s place in Kapiti, not a lot of sleep that night, trouble with the cat and I was over tired to the max. Sunday we all headed to Levin to unload the truck and put our stuff into storage, what a mission that was. The truck was empty by 3pm and I was absolutely exhausted, I was cold and hot and sweaty, my whole body was shaking and I still had to drive to Palmerston North to drop off the truck. Leaving Levin I had no idea if I would even make it, my cell phone was on the seat beside me, just in case. They say it takes forty minutes to get to Palmy from Levin by truck, it seemed to take me forever…............ My next conscious memory was waking up Monday night, I had slept for 24 hours straight and I still felt totally shattered, at least the ground didn’t shake so that was a good thing. We were at a friend’s house in Palmy, all our stuff in storage and our cat in a cattery down the road. \nThis is what it’s like to be a refugee, it sucks big time. Nothing to call your own, no freedom and nothing to do with your time except wait. Tuesday we went to Levin to the WINZ office to sort out our future, sounds easy when you put it like that. It was anything but easy. We had bills to pay, a credit card we couldn’t afford, car payments to make and we still had to find a place to live. Where do you start when you have your whole life to sort out? WINZ were amazing; I don’t care what anyone says about them, I wouldn’t be here now if they hadn’t been as helpful as they were. We arranged a benefit, got the car payments sorted out and started to look for a place to live. Money was the biggest problem in all this, how to afford all the trips to look for a place, how to pay to rent one when we did and then the cost of moving in. None of these things are too hard to do if you are in full control of all your faculties, sadly though I wasn’t. Finally we were in a place, three bedrooms, log fire and garage, our stuff was out of storage and the cat was home with us. If only that was all that was needed; now it was time to try and sort out my head. \nTrips to the doctor were almost weekly in the beginning, trying to get my meds right. Authors note, I’m still trying to sort them. My counseling sessions were weekly and life slowly started to turn round for the better. It is funny that; sitting here now writing this; it seems as though someone else lived through all of these events. Well you might think that all my problems were behind me and to be honest that’s sort of what I thought too. Boy was I ever wrong. Debts and more debts. Prior to the September earthquake my partner and I had been on a good income, over one thousand dollars a week combined. Now we found ourselves having to live on just over four hundred a week, the car payments and the credit card were killing us so we started looking for help. First point of contact was to ring around the organizations that were working to help the people of Christchurch; I won’t name names but as I might have guessed all their efforts were focused on Christchurch itself and those that were in the greatest need. This annoyed me at the time; however looking back on it now I can see why and its OK, that’s how it should have been. Next we tried all the usual options, banks and finance companies for debt consolidation but with little or no joy. One afternoon at the Levin Budget office our adviser suggested we file for an NAP (No Asset Procedure). This is one step bellow bankruptcy and it was to be the only way to get ourselves out of the hole we were in. As you might imagine though it was just another thing to stress me and I lost track of the sleepless nights trying to decide whether to or not. \nAnyone reading this that is in any sort of financial trouble; I urge you to stick up your hand and ask for advice, it was the best thing I ever did. The first six months in Levin were pretty rough, lack of money, lack of sleep, winter weather all combined to add to my depression. I wasn’t in a happy place at all. The warmer weather around October saw us moving into a smaller and cheaper place, this solved all but the last of the money problems. The new house and the improving weather saw me getting a new lease on life, in conjunction with my doctor and my Councillor I decided to try and change my future. Rather than just get better and get back to work as a truck driver I figured that it was time to use my mind for a change, this piece is a step in that direction too, as I have always wanted to be a writer I decided to enroll at Massey as an extramural student and study for a BA. A big ask I hear you say and you would be right, it hasn’t been easy so far and I know it will only get harder, however I am sure that it will be worth it in the end. I have a good brain; I just never used it before. OK so I’m off and running towards a better future, I hope. Life doesn’t really seem to like me though because for some reason it just keeps putting obstacles in my way. They don’t come much bigger than the end of a relationship, nine and a half years, all done and over with. I guess you could say that we simply grew to want different things; we are all growing and changing all the time so it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise when it happens. Back to the drawing board, study went through a bit of a rough patch, for a while I had no net access and fell behind, then I moved a couple of times, finally ending up in Marton in November 2012. \nWill I ever settle? Who knows, anyway here I am now, I’m in a new relationship, engaged to a wonderful woman, she is my friend as well as my soul mate. We have both had similar experiences with regards to the Christchurch earthquakes and are both on long term medication. My study is back on track and in the coming few years I plan to finish my degree and then look at getting into a social work or counseling role, to pay forward some of the help I have received over the last few years. From September 2010 till now I have been through an amazing journey, a scary journey and at times all I have wanted to do is just go to sleep and never wake up, I did consider taking my own life a few times on the way, never for more than a few minutes at a time, I was lucky to have people around me who cared for and supported me. I won’t name them here, they know who they are and to them I say thank you from the bottom of my heart.",

Being originally from California, I was quite used to reports of earthquakes and was somewhat numb to those initial reports coming from Christchurch.  At the time, my job was as a census-taker for the 2011 Census.  In a bit of irony, after those initial reports, my next visit was to a young mother whose husband was in Christchurch doing some consulting work.  She was obviously distressed, but had the presence of mind to keep her children isolated from the reports.  She had moved her two young children to the bedroom where they could be entertained by a DVD playing some cartoon while she watched the TV in the living room for some indication of the area where her husband might be.  Hours after that visit came the directive to cease all census-taking operations.\nA few months later I stopped by to see if that young woman’s partner had survived.  I learned then that he was still in Christchurch, recovering from having a limb amputated.  I also learned that she had spent an agonising eight days trying to find out if her husband was still alive.

        "text": "February 2011\n\nUniversity of Canterbury \n\nEnglish Building\n\nI remember eating lunch at my desk, and looking at the clock, and thinking that the student who had wanted to meet with me should be showing up soon. Then I heard the rumble and the building started to shake. My office is only on the third floor, so the shaking was not as bad as it was for some, but almost immediately I realized I needed to get under my desk — which is, fortunately, a large, old-fashioned one — and so I did. The quake seemed to go on and on, and some books fell from the shelves. But when it was over, I just thought that it was a particularly sharp and long-lasting aftershock. I didn’t realize how bad it had been. I poked my head out of my office and a colleague yelled at me “Get out Jennifer!” So I grabbed my bags and got out. \nOutside we were all mingling in the nearest parking lot. I wasn’t sure if my husband had been on campus, or on his way to work, and I was trying to see if he was there. I met up with my colleague Phil and we made the mistake of walking back towards the buildings. It was then that the first big aftershock hit, and the building above us was terrifying as it creaked and swayed. We retreated back to the parking lot.\nEventually Phil and another colleague, Jennifer, and I got into Phil’s car to try to get back to the Lyttleton-Sumner area. We knew by then that the epicenter had been in that area and I was imagining the worst. I also knew that my husband might have taken a number 3 bus, and by then we had heard that one of those buses had been crushed. I felt chilled and I shook, and sometimes cried. The other two were calmer but of course still upset.\nWe got to Jennifer’s house in Graham Road fairly quickly, and she lent me a sweater. Then Phil and I set out for what we knew would be a long drive. And it was. As we sat in traffic we listened to the news on the radio getting worse and worse. Eventually Phil decided to go over Dyer’s Pass, as it was clear that we wouldn’t get anywhere on Moorhouse or on the highway going east. He thought the Sumner Road might possibly still be open from Lyttleton. I doubted this, but I thought I could always walk home if I had to.\nWe got over Dyer’s Pass eventually, passing stunned people, crumpled houses, and lots of liquefaction going through Cashmere. Going down the pass we had to skirt boulders in some places, and we could see the same on the road  to Lyttleton.\nWhen we turned into Lyttleton, we saw another colleague who was standing near his house; he looked dazed, but he said he was ok, although his house’s chimney had collapsed. As we drove through the town we saw the churches sagging badly, although most houses — from the outside — didn’t look too bad. We drove up the road towards the Time Ball and the Sumner Road, but even before we got there people told us the road was closed up there. Before we turned around we saw the Time Ball looking like a medieval ruin, its walls gaping. \nAt Phil’s house his partner and her mother were clearly shaken but otherwise unharmed. Annie’s mother was distressed that she couldn’t offer me tea, as the power was off, and I thought that was very kind although all I really wanted was to get home, rather like Dorothy and Kansas. Annie lent me socks and sneakers, and Phil a knapsack, and he announced his intention to take me up the path, as it was clear by now that only walking was an option. I told him he didn’t have to, of course, but as it turned out I was grateful not only for his company, but for his guidance. The path was so covered with boulders that it was hard to see where it was supposed to go, in some places.\nLater we were told that a couple of people had died up there, and even before we started up the path a woman warned us it was dangerous. But we went anyway, and nothing happened. We encountered one man returned to Lyttleton after escorting his sister in law (I think) to Sumner, and he hadn’t had any problems either. Phil said goodbye at the top of the hill — he had the most dangerous bit to do again — and I continued on, but from there the path has no overhanging cliffs and it was completely clear. I could look down onto Sumner, which from that distance looked the same as ever, and almost enjoy being above all the destruction and anxiety for a while. \nAt the bottom of the hill I faced the prospect of walking down Evans Pass Road with no enthusiasm, but there were some workers there and one, who was returning home, kindly offered me a lift. He dropped me at my street and I stumbled down it, dreading returning and wishing I were there already. Before I could go up to my house several neighbors hailed me, asking how I was, and then my husband appeared and came down with the dogs. There was no emotional greeting, as we just talked about what had happened, and Christian showed me the bricks that had fallen off the house and the window that had imploded. \nWe did some more cleaning before bed that day — he had already done most of it — but I was still in shock, still shaking sometimes, still cold. Sometimes you wonder when the shock really wears off. The obvious symptoms go, but your mind is scarred by it for a long time.",

        "text": "4 September 2010, I knew I had to get to the doorway.  The violent shaking woke me, I grabbed my teddy bear (the important stuff!) and ran.  Well I tried to run but the room was in turmoil.  All I had to do is get out of bed and get to the doorway perhaps two or three metres away.  The bed was moving, so was everything.  The wardrobe doors I had to go past were opening and shutting violently as the earth spun out of control.  I had the doors on one side of me and the bed on the other side all coming together to stop me in my goal.  In what seemed like for ever I got there, but it was hard to stay there because the doorway was moving too.  I clung to the door frame, and my teddy bear, and waited for the nightmare to end.  From memory I think the quake went on for about 40 seconds.  Well it seemed like 40 hours.  It just kept going and going and going.\nWhen it stopped I thought of the cat, Penny.  She had been on the bed but was long gone.  It was 36 hours before I found her cowering under the bed in the spare room.  I am guessing that’s where she had gone and that’s where she stayed.  She was terrified!\nThere didn’t seem to be an damage to my house but it was still dark and who knew what daylight would show.  Amazingly power and phone were still on.  I had a phone call from my brother who lives out toward Rolleston.  They were ok.  I sent an email to my other brother (in Wellington) to tell him what had happened.  Then, believe it or not, I went back to bed and slept for about an hour.  Can’t believe I managed to do that, maybe it was just my reaction to the stress.\nWaking up to a different world.  I still had power and so had the television on immediately showing pictures of the rest of the city.  Incredible!  Inspite of what had happened I had little concept of the magnitude of damage.  I had arranged to visit a friend who lived in the CBD.  I didn’t realise getting there might be difficult.  Strangely while I could get to my car in the garage (still no damage) the car it had reacted to the quake too.  My car battery was dead.  It had been fine the day before and I hadn’t left anything on.  I really believe that the quake was too much for the car.  Yeah, ok I’m weird but how else do you explain it?\nThe earthquake on 4 September 2010 affected me mentally and emotionally rather than physically.  I had no damage to my house or contents.  Bob Parker was going on the TV that every resident had suffered damage.  I got to the stage where I didn’t admit to having no damage.  It was almost as if people resented you.  So I kept quiet.  My brother had major damage to their farm.  They were much closer to the epi-centre.  My parents had some contents damage to their apartment in the CBD.  But I had nothing.\n\nI was very lucky.\nI worked for a social service organisation at the time and found the attitude of those that ran it strange.  I thought there would be an immediate need for the organisation to open it’s foodbank and drop in centre.  But they didn’t see the need.  Actually it broke my heart because I knew there would be masses of people in need of somewhere to come and talk, let alone in need of food.  In the end I left the job because I couldn’t agree with the organisation’s insistence that there wasn’t need.   I guess my reaction to the big quake and the many after was that of looking at what others needed.  For me it had started with my neighbours.  My neighbours were great in reaching out to see if there were needs.  And that’s what I felt my workplace needed to do.  I wasn’t forced out of my job by the earthquake but the circumstances led me to decide I couldn’t stay.\nOf course in September there was job loss but not as great as to come in February.  So I thought I’d have no trouble getting another job.  It was a long road ahead of me.",

        "text": "February 11th  \n\nAlmost one year on, more quake journalism highlights the shocking sadness’s the bereaved are suffering.  As one person puts it, “time does not heal and if anyone says that to me again, I’ll thump them.”    More and more details are being revealed of the horrors of memories people are carrying around with them, like the man who sat on a pile of rubble from a collapsed building talking to his trapped wife.  They talked for some hours but she was not able to be rescued. \n19th February and in a few days, as we are constantly reminded by the media, it will be one year since the February quake changed our lives.  I wept again tonight as I watched TV One’s Sunday and we listened to the first-hand account from survivors of the 2 major building collapses.\nThe grief of the Japanese parents, so far away and the quiet calm sadness of the school principal of Toyama as he carefully told us of his nightmare, receiving calls from the trapped students, their last communication.  And from another building, the bride to be and her work colleague, their miraculous escapes, and now a year later, married and for one of them, pregnant and back working for the company in a new one story office block.  These stories of then and now give hope to the viewer and astonishing immediacy to the awful events of a year ago, though they do not allow to see the in-between. How these people got from then, until now, the daily experience of living, within a constantly seismic environment.\nI was on my way on Saturday to the birthday celebrations of my granddaughter Lili.  She had just turned nine and her birthday party was to be held at Orton Bradley Park on the Peninsular.  Cars loaded with children, picnic food and a gorgeous cake, we all headed towards the park.  I had four girls in my car and as I drove, I would hear their conversation swing to earthquakes.  They were all talking at once, sharing their experiences of February one year ago.  I started to listen and made a suggestion.  “I would love to hear your stories but one at a time please”, I asked.  So for the next 25 minutes of driving I listened and was once again astonished and moved.  Two out of the four girls in the car knew children who had lost a parent and this was a significant part of their on-going responses to living with quakes.  Change, loss, and shock, these are all spoken about as part of their stories and yet they are still children, bubbling with enthusiasm in their present situation en route to an adventure.  One little girl looks at me and says, “You know it might go on for 30 years”.  I say, “I’ve heard that.  Do you all mind living in a place where there are so many earthquakes,” I ask.  Three out of them say, “no, we’re okay,” and a 4th says, “I really don’t like it.  I’m so scared.” Then another adds, “well, it is scary, I’ve only just started sleeping in my own bed again.”\nAs we drove in the gate to the park, they are still recounting stories and I have to bring them back to the present.  “Look, we’re here, and I promise on the way back you can tell me more of your stories, but right now, let’s get out of the car and help sort out the picnic and the dress-ups.”  They jump out and join the other groups arrived just ahead of us, no more quake stories as they run wild on the wide open space of the park and down to the river; no stories here, just a birthday to celebrate. \n22nd February 2012 11.40 pm\n\nOne year anniversary.  \n\nWe’ve done it, we’ve got there through it all.  Right now, it is pouring with rain outside the little house where I am just preparing for bed.  Mark is up in the main house doing the dishes.  Always this mentality prevails, that if we don’t get the dirty dishes sorted and there is another major quake, there will be no power, no water, which equals dishes problems.  It’s raining heavily – the dried out garden will love that.  During dinner we shared with S & P memories of the times together when they sheltered us and fed us.  We are raw tonight.  The aspect of today that had the most impact for all of us, was hearing the names of the victims being read aloud – 13 minutes to read the 185 names.\nIt is quiet now March again but we do not know if it is over.  I read a new sign in Lyttelton: \n\n“It doesn’t matter how slowly you go as long you don’t stop!”\nAnd we just keep going.\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Louise Swatton conducted four weeks after the 4 September 2010 earthquake .\nI live in Purau in an old residential block built in 1880. A villa bungalow built by the Gardener family when they split their estate. \nIn the night of the earthquake we had to check on the cows as they were calving and a cold southerly storm came through. I had to go out around midnight to try and sort a cow and her newborn calf out, with the torch, so that’s why the torch was not next to my bed, but I left it in the kitchen when I came in. \nWhen the earthquake happened I had been up several times already because of the cows, but I was fast asleep. My husband and I got up and stood under the door frame and held hands and it shook a lot and then suddenly I thought of my daughter, who was at the West Coast. And then I spent the rest of the time praying “keep her safe! keep her safe!”, which I wasn’t really thinking I would. \nAs soon as the quake had finished I phoned my daughter who was on a geology trip on the other side of the fault, but of course I thought the earthquake came from the big Alpine Fault  and I thought if we are shaking this much… they were at a field work station just outside of Westport. She had gone there studying geology on the Alpine Fault! But she was fine, in fact they were really cross because it was the last day of their field work trip and they had all these eminent geologists… and they’d missed it!!  They were furious! .\nThen I rang my mother who lives in a granny flat and then I went to the cows and checked their field shelter was OK.  \nIt was an East-West shake, so everything on the West shelf in the kitchen came down. \nI have a trifle bowl that survived since  Victorian time, it survived my husband’s aunt who was blind, a maiden aunt who looked after it, it survived the blitz when the house was blown apart, and now it survived the earthquake, this beautiful cut-glass trifle bowl. But I haven’t put it back up yet. \nI felt the aftershocks were like a home invasion – you close your curtains and you lock your door when you go to bed at night and they enter into your house without an invite, not a very nice visitor, you’ve got no right of reply, there is no one to moan at, no one to shout at, and this darn thing just comes on in. \nI work as a community nurse, so on the Monday morning I came and said “Look we need to check on the ederly, otherwise the GP will need to spend 2 hours with each patient, because people need to talk.’ \n And it was lovely, I phoned Margaret  and she said “Let’s get on and do it.” and it was superb, it made such a difference knowing that Timebank were contacting all the elderly who needed time, I know  that WINZ were going to contact those that live by themselves, but you need somebody personal, somebody who lives in Lyttelton. And there was somewhere for them to have a cup of tea [in the Lyttelton Info Centre] , because it’s really frightening. \nOn Monday everyone that came in wanted to talk, it was unusual, but copable. On the Tuesday I got John and Rose to put up tape on all the windows, because I knew the aftershocks would carry on for a good year and at that stage everyone was talking about a ‘6’, I know the 6 is still in the background, way in the background, but I know it is still possible. \n But I think the biggest change for us [at the Lytteton health centre] was Wednesday. Wendy and I had just got into the building at 10 to 8 and we were talking about… on Tuesday someone had come in and really panicked everyone with a story that there was going to be a 6 in the next hour and a half… that caused so much emotional damage to some of the people. \n\nBut on Wednesday the building really shook, we lost power and we couldn’t get doctors through – in fact I was telling some of the doctors not to come,  because we didn’t know what was going to happen. \nI cope if I am organising things – I am probably quite bossy. Like most nurses!\nNow, 4 weeks after the quake, we still have huge numbers of people coming through affected by the eathquakes. Elderly people who won’t go to bed –  lots of them will go to bed after 1 or 2 o’clock because they think that’s the busiest time for earthquakes. And I am very much an evidence-based type of person so I have been using this website to show people how the quakes have changed, how few there are now compared to before. I printed it out and for some people that made a lot of difference that they could see. I am lucky that I can ask my daughter who  can ask Mark Quigley who can answer questions. My daughter was really miffed and cross  because she was meant to have him as her lecturer for this part of the semester,  but he is too busy now with other things!\nI learned not to leave my batteries for the radio and torch lying around to get rusty. I don’t think anyone of us expected this number of aftershocks. Compared to Haiiti I really appreciate how good New Zealand is with all its earth quake planning. \nThis interview is one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton .  We are very grateful to Bettina and the interviewees for allowing their interview transcripts to be posted on QuakeStories.",

        "text": "I had moved here from America and had been living in New Zealand for exactly one month. The culture was fresh, the people were different and I had a hard time placing myself in a different country.\nThe day before I turned sixteen was regular, and seemingly normal. I was sitting on a bench with a group of people I didn’t know to well, waiting for my friend that I usually ate lunch with but she hadn’t shown so I was drawing. Looking up at the sky it was rather cloudy and dull and the air had a stormy scent. The first bell went, not wanting to get to class too early I waited for a few minutes then put my pen and paper in my bag and walked across the quad toward my chemistry classroom which was on the other side of the school. Nearly there, just about to pass under the covered walkway. I could see the entrance to my classroom which was disguised by plants. A rumble sounded in the distance, and a thunder shot through the clouds. I looked up to the deep gray cover of cloud “Yep, It’s going to rain”  I thought. I just reached the walkway and the ground began to move… actually move, as if it were unstable. That wasn’t thunder, that rumble was not a storm it was the ground, the earth. I grabed hold of the pole that lined and held up the covered walkway. I looked behind me, where I had just come from and I saw the concrete ground move like the ocean moves but I isn’t suppose to do that. With the ground everything else shook from side to side. There were no noises except for the screams of other students but even those were muffled and numb. I heard my own breathing quite well, which made me feel isolated and alone from the people near me. The shaking kept going, I tried to walk and do something but i couldn’t, the ground was too unstable. \nGradually the shaking stoped, but I didn’t trust the ground anymore and I had a hard time walking normally. I thought I was fine, but my thoughts that had been kept silent now flooded everypart of me. “I am ok, alive, it’s fine. Was that an earthquake? I was in an earthquake. A nartual disaster. People die in those. Where are the people? Are they gone?” and with that I was crying, shaking, nauseous, and out of breath. Someone simpathetically asked if I was ok, but all I could do was shake my head and ask where to go and they said to the field and to find my form teacher. I walked straight ahead, still crying, shivering even though I wasn’t cold, and still unable to completely gain my balance.\nI found my form class. I didn’t stop shaking, or crying even though I was around people and safe considering there wasn’t anything to fall on me. Everyone was tring to get a hold of their family members. I lived right across the road so I wasn’t as worried. When the first after shock happend I felt like I was getting beat up by a bully that was hitting me while I was already down. \nEventaully, after nearly an hour, kids began to go home and parents came. My mom showed up and needed to find my sister, so I walked home on my own. She was quite hesitant to let me go but I told her I needed to get home, I just couldn’t stay here. I walked to the gate that opened to memorial and walked across the street. My dad was in the car listening to the news and when he saw me enter the driveway he jumped out of the car. When I saw him, I broke down crying again and hugged him.\nWhen I heard the news later that day, and I heard how many people had died, the damage in town and I felt guilty for crying so much because I was fine, but there were people who weren’t at all. But the truth is that things happen to all of us, and we feel what we feel about them. Even though an experience may be seen as worse than another experience, the feeling these expereinces produce may be the same. We are who we are about things. During the whole day of February 22, I couldn’t stop thinking about 9/11. I was living in Pennsylvania when the planes hit the towers, and the Pentagon. I remember how I felt that day more than I remember it specifically. That feeling was exactly how I felt on September 22; that fear and utter sadness which is why this day frightened me so much. Except, with 9/11 there was an enemy, a person or people to blame, and a justice that could be served. No one made this earthquake happen, there is no one to blame. This just happend. Even with other natural disasters, they can be seen before they arrive and the proper precausions can be taken. Earthquakes just happen.  There is no justice, or revenge to be taken here. There is however recovery, and mending that can be done to the city, and the society. \n\nThis is my story, and this was my first year living in New Zealand.",

        "text": "Earthquake Canterbury – 14 Days of Shaking\nWritten over the weeks between Sept 4th and Sept 18th 2010. I began to write this diary in Governors Bay, Christchurch then carried it on in Hanmer Springs where we took some respite from the shakes. It is here I get the stories from the grandchildren and Mark because it is only when we are out of the quaking zone that the children have the perspective and confidence to talk about what has happened to them on Sept 4th. I end this piece of writing in Christchurch where I thought I was finishing an amazing account of an earthquake and its 14 days of aftershocks!!!\nSeptember 4th 2010 4.35 am:\n\nI woke to hear the loudest sound roaring through the bedroom.  Everything was juddering – dadada, dada dada, dadada, on and on it went, rising in crescendo, until you could not imagine anything being able to be louder, or more movement without the house falling around us.  We hung on to each other, Mark, my husband, and I, and called to the 3 grandchildren, sleeping also upstairs in the house.   I thought we were all going to die here in the blackness – in this chaos – not knowing what was going on.  I knew it was an earthquake but it was not anything like any of the earthquakes I had ever experienced in my lifetime.  This one was off the chart.  Like a science fiction, not real.  As the first episode died down slightly, Mark went to the children’s rooms, returning first with 2 girls then a boy, all awake and ‘owl like’ in their terror.  We clung to each other as more terrible jolts began and more glass fell.\nI found myself reassuring the children, trying to sound so in control.  “It’s okay.  It’s an earthquake, a big one, but it’s all going to be okay.”  The children are very quiet, but cling to me like limpets.  We ring people on our mobile, other family members. A son in Akaroa, a son and daughter-in-law and 2 other grandchildren in Avonside Christchurch and friends here in the Bay.  All have stories to tell. All are shocked, but all are alive.\nMark reminds me it is my birthday. “Happy  birthday dear Rosie.” The dear children try to sing to me and I add, “Happy birthday to me,” so happy to be alive.\nAs the light comes, we look around and survey the damage.  The rooms are strewn with broken glass and fallen, sharply rearranged objects.  We make our way to the bathroom with the children, toilet stops essential with such shocked people.  Water is brought from the devastated kitchen, our mouths dry with fear.  I stand downstairs, astonished at the state of my home, in those minutes which seemed like tens of minutes.  The pictures left on the walls are hanging at odd angles, such a vicious assault on the home.  I am completely amazed.  I look out the window at an exquisite night sky, the quarter moon hanging so still.  It seems impossible what has just occurred.  No time to contemplate before the next shock is hitting.  I think we had 98 aftershocks in that first 24 hours post the ‘big one’.  We are concentrating on keeping warm.  It is five degrees outside. And keeping as calm as possible in the circumstances and getting some routines for the children, especially with their mum away in Auckland and Dad in Australia.   I manage well for the first two hours and then I start to shake uncontrollably and cry. The children are left trying to console me – they sing to me and stroke me.  And then the bird calls for early morning spring in Governors Bay begin. It is as if nothing at all unusual has occurred. But it has.\nWhen crisis hits, I write. That’s what helps.  It reminds me, after the first big quake, of how I felt after brain surgery, utterly vulnerable and treading unknown waters.  And of course there is a whole population of Canterbury, New Zealand, having variations on these thoughts. The wobbling earth becomes a focus of our lives, despite trying to get back to ‘normal’ lives again. There is an alertness to sound and movement that is exhausting, day after day.\n5th September 2010:\n\nI am too busy managing a household without power and coping with traumatised self and children to write anything.\n6th September 1.00am:\n\nAnd the last big aftershock was just 10 minutes ago. My birthday will be memorable. The 61st birthday as we were awoken by the fury of the earth. A 7.1 or more earthquake centred quite close to Darfield,  30kms west of Christchurch.  Terrifying in the extreme, and for 42 hours the ground has been wobbling.  It is very unsettling.\n8th September 2-30am:\n\nAnd we have entered day 5 of the earthquake and its aftermath. A light rain is falling outside.  The sounds are familiar and slightly comforting, but not comforting enough to dispel the deep fear that has become a nightly companion to those of us living in the earthquake zone and experiencing the aftershocks from the Christchurch quake.  Since that initial shock, the shock that you experience after such a terrifying event, it has been a roller coaster for Cantabrians as we try to resume the normal daily activities and attend to the cleanups and the practical necessities of reviewing losses and of putting in insurance claims. There is a need to talk and share the experiences of the initial event and of the days following, with family, friends and neighbours and with colleagues and strangers. There is grief in the community and a need for those of us hit less hard to reach out and comfort those with huge loss and confusion.\nDaylight each day brings a certain relief – somehow because being able to see, makes the aftershocks seem slightly less scary.  Night time has become a time of dread as we feel yet another jolt or tremor.  ‘Tremor’ seems such an inappropriate word to describe the events. It is exhausting, both physically and mentally, as you brace yourself yet again for another rumbling, then shaking, then a jolt. The last one at around 1.00 am or so was only 4.6 but very shallow and closer to Christchurch. I have found myself unable to sleep, constantly imagining I am feeling movement but checking the Geonet site on the computer and seeing only 1 quake registered for Wednesday 8th so far. Yesterday there were 25, 2 of which were 5.2 and 5.4 respectively, the day before, 32.\nHere is another one. “Oh shit,” I say, as my whole being lurches with anticipatory fear. It was short and small but a constant reminder that the earth under us is unsettled is rearranging itself, and we the tiny beings on its surface have absolutely no control over what is happening under us. \nHow the grandchildren are doing tonight in their respective homes, I wonder.  Some of them are so disturbed, fluctuating from extreme upset to withdrawn, pale anxiety. The sun came out and it was a hot nor wester on day 3 and for a while the children played outside, happily bouncing on the trampoline, 5 cousins, 2 dogs, and 2 rabbits. But like a war zone, the events carry on and the uncertainty surrounding the events, and we the adults seem not to have the answers the children require to help them to feel safe. \nLater on Wednesday 8th September 2010:\n\nHow often do we see news reports of earthquakes and devastation in countries far from our own. Those images of piles of rubble and children staring out from the page with empty eyes, or people huddled together outside, looking lost and helpless.  We now know that confusion, that state of living through an aftermath of such a huge shake up, but to know also we are the lucky ones.  This is difficult to comprehend. No one has died in this event, most of us have homes to shelter in, homes that have been affected to a greater or lesser degree, but at day 5 most of us with habitable homes have all the services restored. We have food, fuel, warmth and communication services.  This is the privilege of living in a wealthy country – a country where there has been care taken to make buildings which will have resilience to such natural disasters as earthquakes.   Our planners and architects and engineers have anticipated such events in their planning, but not even the best of planning can prevent the devastation and chaos the earth can deliver in some instances.  It is of comfort to see how the earthquake strengthened older heritage buildings have come through – are coming through – this event. Not so the many character brick buildings around the city or some of the stone churches.\nToday a brief drive and walk around revealed such losses, places we have had close association with over the years.  Weird to drive past the hairdresser where Mark and I had been sitting on Friday the 3rd having our hair cut and to see it so destroyed. The furniture and kitchenware shop next door, all the years of purchasing there, and around the corner to the cheesemonger – forlorn – an island of functioning in the midst of the chaos.  Those premises untouched by the quake, and yet probably doomed for demolition, as how can this tiny island unspoilt stand alone. The owners and staff in shock and grief about losing what they have built up over the last 8 years, and those of us who have been the recipients of the cheeses equally distressed at the look of this popular spot. And next door again, the antique shop, a touch Provencal with its beautiful yellow and blue exterior and lavender hedges out the front.  Inside furniture of another era, early English and French ,a smell of beeswax polish and a feeling of calm and beauty – all gone now.\nOn we go – and next is the picture framer. This looks totally bizarre with the roof actually inside the shop and across the road a string of little restaurants, tastes of other cultures ripped open for the world to see – no more food served from these premises – closed, closed, closed.\nAround the corner and into Kilmore Street, the theatre we have so often sat in as audience and used as a venue, slightly musty and decrepit, but charming and characterful, a part of the theatre fabric of Christchurch – all gone now.  It is full of gaping wounds, doomed for demolition. On we go. Next  the beautiful little church in Hereford Street, Latimer Square where our first child was baptised. Huge piles of rubble surround what is left of the tower.  A sad little handwritten sign on the gate reads – “If God is willing, services resume Sunday 12th…”\nWe cannot get into the centre. Weird to see police and army personnel guarding the entrance to the city centre, our city, but we can see up Worcester Street far enough to confirm what we have heard from the media, that large parts of Manchester and Worcester Street are damaged.\nIt is comforting to drive on and go to the Mediterranean Warehouse and see its shelves full, and warm kitchen smells emanating.  We are two of only a handful of customers. It feels weird to be in this usually bustling place but we are comforted by the familiarity found here.  A stock up of olive oil and tomato products and olives and cheese and spread and we are on our way again to the wine merchant. There is comfort. Their building also in tact and the shelves stocked again, even though there is a strong smell of spilt alcohol emanating through the shop.  It is a relief to see some normality at the counter.\nWhen there is a gap in the after shakes, confidence returns to us, and that’s how it was for me this morning. A restless night, but here was a new day.  I went downstairs to make a cup of tea. Lit the gas, put the jug on and stoked the wood fire.  And then wham, another aftershock hit. Only 5.1 but shallow and extremely close by. I am hit by a small airborne ornament (a wooden giraffe) I have foolishly put back on the bookshelf.  I dive for cover under the oak dining table. This table haven has been well used by the grandchildren over the weekend as they set up camp there with their pillows. This big shake was centred around Lyttelton  10 km from us and nearby Heathcote. More devastation and grief as homes already weakened take more damage.  This last big quake leaves us all on edge to the extreme. Friends  and family report loss of concentration and tearfulness and a desperate feeling of wanting to flee. Some families make preparations to leave Christchurch and later in the morning they leave for Dunedin.\nThursday 9th September 5.58am:\n\nWe woke half an hour ago after the longest stretch of uninterrupted sleep since the night before the big quake.  It felt good. The birds began their morning calls which are now gathering in volume, something that is normal for an early spring morning in Governors Bay, New Zealand, yet as I wake properly, the fear returns.  It has been too peaceful for too many hours and I am right. A few minutes ago another rumble and rattle of an aftershock and just then, at 6.05am, another quick rattle.\nMy dressing table top surface so chaotic after the first big quake, I do not bother to put back together. Perfumes on the floor along with the bedroom mirror, face down on the carpet. Pictures from the family gallery in the hall now all face down on the bedroom window seat and floor after their spectacular crash into the stairwell.  We are on edge again. Another day of abnormality post quake begins. Another quake just minutes after the last, and the birds still sing on.\nThursday 9th September 11.07 pm:\n\nAs we prepare to go to bed the fear re-emerges.  I have reassured the grandchildren at their homes, “you are going to be fine, please don’t worry.” The almost five year old rang tonight to say “I think the earthquake is going to sleep.” She reassures me and herself.\nBut they are not asleep – another night of rumbling and crashes ahead of us. We are so tired now that unless they are bigger than 4 we hardly move in our beds.  We awake after another jolt at 6.45 on Friday 10th, as exhausted as we were on going to bed. I think of all the parents over the city sharing their beds with terrified children.\nOn Thursday the 9th day 6  we have a day of practical help on the cleanup in Avonside at son and daughter-in-law’s house in Keller Street.  Their street is hit hard, water and sewage services remain erratic .  The street is a hive of activity with machinery and human helper’s co-ordinating efforts to bring some order to the neighbourhood.  Strangers and neighbours side by side, shovelling, wheel-barrowing, sweeping, hosing the black silt and soil from all it is sticking to.\nIt feels good to be outside and contributing to a cleanup, bringing some semblance of normality to a battered neighbourhood.  I am amazed by the appearance of people from other parts of town just coming along to offer their services, particularly the students, many of them unfamiliar with the activities of shovelling and wheel-barrowing, but quick to learn and contribute.  And the man who set up his barbeque on the footpath and handed out bread, sausages and water.  He was not a local but he said he knew this street was needy, so he just came to offer some support.\nIt was a good day and the after shocks not so noticeable because there was so much other noise and vibration from the heavy machinery.\nSaturday September 11th:\n\nIt is 3.00am on Saturday September 11th.   A whole community continues to be disrupted by the events of those seconds when the earth convulsed so close to a large urban area of New Zealand.   I have woken again, not because of an aftershock, which I believe to be happening almost constantly now despite the fact that we are far away tonight from the experience of these events.  It all got too much for some of us in our family yesterday. Like many other Cantabrians, we climbed into our cars with 3 of the five grandchildren living in Christchurch and headed north. It was a bit disconcerting to see on Geo net that the area we were headed to, Hanmer Springs, had been the location that day of a minor quake, but hey, it still seemed a better option to us all than sitting out another anxious night of jiggling and jolting in our beds in Christchurch.\nSo here we are, temporarily relocated in the spa resort of Hammer Springs,  150  km north west of Christchurch,  The children were deliriously happy to have got away and the adults equally relieved. We toasted our good fortune at a local Indian café with ginger beer and smiles and laughter from the children which we haven’t seen in such supply for over a week.  So why am I awake writing with my first night off?  Well, the dog has woken me with a simple need/request for water – a thirsty dog.  The household is quiet otherwise.   The dog’s needs now met but I am unable to go back to sleep, the new patterns of nightly wakefulness too difficult to break.\nBut hey, we are away from the torture in Christchurch. It’s morning and we are thinking about how we will face going back.  A whole population affected, spooked to one degree or another, by the strangeness of our new lives, post impact.  Literally at sea, but on land, the land we “know” or “knew,” Canterbury, now so weird, so different, as it tries to find equilibrium post quake.  “Getting earthed” something we talk about when we are feeling out of sync, out of balance in some way.  The earth, our marker point for stability.  “Getting ourselves grounded” another term of solidity. But now, these statements have lost all validity, all meaning, as the very ground we so trust in to make us feel solid again, moves and shakes and rumbles, terrorising us dozens of times daily.  So far 400 plus shakes since Saturday.  Even after all the cleanups, the demolitions, the rebuilding’s, how long will it take us to have confidence again to live our lives in Canterbury, the area of New Zealand we came to live.\nSaturday 11th 3.00pm: \n\nWe continue to unwind in the hot pools in Hanmer, surrounded by other Christchurch escapees.  We all share our stories as we soak in the warmth and safety of the pools.  We’re all still jittery and jump at any sound resembling a quake or any wobble.   In fact from talking to people, a lot feel they are wobbling most of the time.  It is as if we have all been on a long sea journey. The children are unwinding and eating again.  We have a large brunch this morning, or a huge late lunch.  Family members variously reading the Christchurch Press newspaper, everyone still avid for more news.   For the last week it’s as if nothing else exists.  We reflect on the weirdness of the week.  I get a text from our hairdresser.  “Due to the quake we have relocated,” – the new location SURREAL Hairdressers, Victoria Street. Surreal indeed are the circumstances of businesses requiring to relocate\nThe weekend in Hanmer was great, but we have to return home to work,  and to school for the grandchildren. Along with hundreds of others, we head back to the wounded city. I don’t want to feel negative, but can’t help it as we get closer and see more and more signs of the damage again, a reminder that the events of the past week are not a weird dream, but real. We are disoriented at times as we drive into the city, landmarks now completely erased by demolition work undertaken during the weekend.\nThe grandchild in our car is beginning to get anxious.  We stop at the Supermarket in suburb Beckenham where Mark goes to buy a few grocery items.  My grandson and I are in the car when suddenly we are swayed and jolted.  I wind down the window and a woman with children in the next car says, “Another one, that was quite big. Did your car move?”  “Yes,” I said.  We take comfort in sharing with strangers the weirdness we are all experiencing. My grandson is disturbed again, as are the others, when we arrive at his home.  I am wishing we did not have to come back to what feels like an unsafe zone.  We leave the family and drive home to Governors Bay.  For the first time that I can ever remember, I reached the summit of Dyers Pass and looked down to the harbour and see not exciting beauty – the kind of beauty that sometimes takes your breath away – but something sinister, a reminder of something horrible and not in our control.  I felt sick driving towards the house.  Coming inside it all reminded me of the wobbliness of the week’s events. Pictures still stacked on floors, books stacked, and upstairs, my dressing table contents still in piles on the floor.  It didn’t feel like home should feel.  And I have been constantly on edge, back and forth to the computer web sites checking the number and intensity of recent shocks.  I feel a little reassured that we have only had 10 aftershocks in the previous 24 hours.  Can  add another to that now, though. Trying to go to sleep and I have been jolted to total alertness by a strange, short jolt.  Almost like a twitch, the earth still uncomfortable under us. I cannot imagine ever being able to relax again, being able to forget that event, being able to enjoy this bedroom again as a safe and calm place.  How can I reassure the grandchildren when I am a complete nervous wreck myself?  \nIt is raining and cold outside. My husband says “relax, listen to the rain on the roof,” but I can’t do anything but lie here and wait for the next event.\nSeptember 14th: \n\nDay 10, post earthquake.  I am up at 4.30 am to see Mark off – he is driving to a job 3 hours south.  I feel anxious about him leaving and me still in what is dark night. \nJust a small shake up now, a twitch just a reminder, all not quite settled yet.  There are still piles of items on floors. I am not comfortable about returning them to shelves yet. And we are still discovering breakages, rearrangements, near misses, books teetering on shelves.  More cracks in plaster between gib sheets and bricks loosening in the fireplace.  \nAnother shake –  5.39  am now. Lui the dog is as on edge as me.  No way I am going to be able to go back to sleep now.  The shakes are like a torture weapon making the whole population sleep deprived and anxious.  \nOn the surface of things people are doing what is recommended. “Getting back to normal”, whatever that is.  We are told to try and carry on with normal daily activities, children back to school, parents back to work, where they have a work to go back to, and to resume shopping. Buy, buy, they tell us.  We need the economy to be working and it only works if money is going around.\nThe problem is we have only so much energy in a day and a large portion of it is being taken up at present coping with your body being in overdrive with anxiety. Then another large portion is being directed to assisting others in the family or the community, making sure the basics are being accounted for, that families are fed, have the water and sewerage sorted. And  then the psychological demands of the children, the neediness of those in the family not wanting to be alone, and you can count me as one of those.  Add to that trying to carry on the cleanups in and around your homes and businesses, physically exhausting, and often meticulous work as you sort through the material objects of your life, assessing and noting the damages for insurance purposes.  How much time and energy is left to go back to normal, to go shopping! Or   to start entertaining or to welcome tourists.  And anyway, who in their right mind would want to come to Christchurch at present to enjoy the spring in the city when they would have to endure being shaken by aftershocks.  I mean, damaged or not, who wants to be on a 6th, 7th or 8th floor of a hotel being shaken periodically during the night when you can put your tourist dollars elsewhere and not suffer the shakes.\nBirds are singing in the early morning chorus and I am exhausted.\nSeptember 17th – Day 14:\n\nIt is 2 weeks since it all started and now here we are, 696 shocks later, a city of 400,000 people, adapted to a weird new way of living.\nWe have woken to a sunny, calm day and memories of only one large jolt during the night.  Maybe the earth is settling and we can all get on with the business of living again, of putting back together our injured properties, businesses and interrupted lives.  Spring flowers in full bloom bring visual delight around the city alongside the busy backdrop of heavy machinery demolishing teetering buildings, repairing others – a cityscape of gaping wounds being patched and mended .Inside the buildings deemed safe to enter the resilience of business owners as they begin to trade again, often in very changed circumstances, is remarkable.\nSunday September 18th:\n\n It is a calm, sunny, cold morning, a sprinkling of new snow on Mt Herbert. The night was less disrupted by quakes. Today 714 shakes later we hang the pictures again and put things back on the dressing table. I invite friends to dinner and we toast to the ending of this strange episode in the history of Christchurch.\n\nComments   from  the grandchildren who were staying with us during the first event.\nSophia – Aged 12 years:\n\n‘I’ve never experienced an earthquake before so I didn’t know if it was really big or just small and I shouldn’t worry, but then I felt dust land on myself and thought I really should get my little sister – she had plaster dust on her face and hair. I shook her and woke her up and got under the camp stretcher bed she was on because we were sleeping at Granny’s. I was screaming at the top of my lungs.  “Granny, is it a big one or a small one, Granny, what shall we do?”  It was so noisy no one could hear me. Then grandfather came in and said, “Quick, quick, it’s a big earthquake.” He carried Grace and I dodged the broken glass and we went to Granny and Grandfather’s bed.  Soon after, my brother arrived, shocked.  We snuggled up in bed and then it stopped for a while and then it kept going.\nThere was no room for Grandad. He had to sleep along the bottom of the bed and Lui the dog was there too.  Grace made me feel sick because she squeezed me so hard. We both hung on to Granny. Arlo just lay there with his eyes wide open looking up at the sky. We rang our cousins on the cell phone and they said they had mud all around the house and water too and a terrible smell.\nWe had no power but we had water from the tank and the toilet worked. Granny gave us a bath with the remaining hot water when it got light.  We kept warm with the wood fire and Granny cooked on it.  That night before the earthquake we had thunder and lightening and snow and hail and there was still snow on the roof after the earthquake.  \nIn the morning my cousins came. They had to climb out their window because their doors were jammed and they could not get out.  It was a lovely day in the morning and the sun came out but it didn’t cheer us up as much as I thought it would. I felt depressed and scared and shocked. I couldn’t move and I was so tired.  I could not play with my cousin and she started saying “I hate you” because I would not play with her. I felt dizzy as well.\nMy cousin Lili stayed the night and we all wanted to sleep in Granny and Granddad’s bed. There were big dramas because the children said we wont go anywhere but your bed. Grandad got so angry because he wanted to sleep in his bed with Granny, but in the end he stormed out and went to the kids room to sleep.  We all hung on to Granny, especially Grace, the 4 year old. She squeezed as tight as a baby monkey hanging on to its mother’s back in a running race.  Granny was really grumpy and would not let me stroke her.’\nArlo – Aged 9 years:\n\n‘I woke up with a drawer on my head and I did not know what was happening.  I was shouting, “Grandfather, stop shaking the house.”  Then Grandad got Sophia and Grace and took them to my Granny’s room and I followed closely behind, stepping through picture frames and glass.\n\nI felt horrendously shooken up.  When I was in my Granny’s bed they said I was the best, but it was because I had spit in my mouth and I couldn’t talk.  I spat over the side of the bed so I could talk.  I didn’t know what had happened. I was busting to go to the toilet but it was shaking too bad for anyone to take me so we all waited until daylight.\n\nThe next day I went to my friend Casper and stayed with him for the night. There was a big party because all the neighbours were too scared to be at their houses and they had no power or food so my friend’s mum had dinner for them all.  There were ten families.  There was no room in the house and 27 people altogether. I went to bed in the lounge while everyone was talking by the fire.  I woke up in the middle of the night because of a big shock and went to my friend’s parent’s bed and slept there. The next morning they had their chimney taken down and it felt like another big aftershock.\nWhen I got to my house from my Granny’s car, my Aunty Sol and Uncle Mischa and cousins Inaki and Lili stayed at our house for the night, because our mum was still in Auckland and Sol and Mischa had no water or power or sewerage at their house.  I had to sleep in the bed with my sister Sophia and Uncle Mischa.  There were lots of aftershocks.’\nGrace Aged 4 years:\n\n‘My sister woke me up and I was saying “stop it, stop it,” and I went under the bed.  I held on to her very tight because she was about to die.  I said to Grandfather, “Is someone rocking the house,” and he took me to Granny’s bed.  I said to Arlo, “will you stop rocking the house.”  I hung on to Arlo very tight.  He was about to choke.  Sophia said “I need to go to the toilet,” and I would not let her go.  Granny piggy backed me down to the toilet because there was glass on the floor.  Granny had candles and a torch.  She rang up Philip and Sarah and they said don’t have candles because it might shake the candles.  Lui was a good boy, he sat so still.  I was gone to Granny’s bedroom.  All Granny’s perfume and pictures were on the floor and our TV was broken.’\nAnd from Husband Mark:\n\n‘What’s going on?  I listened – it was like a freight train going through the bedroom, a wobbly train with broken wheels.  Then I thought, “Where are the grandchildren.”  “Kids, it’s alright, you’ll be alright.”  I thought, “is this the big one – are we on the edge of the big one?” And then I got out to bring the girls to our bed and then Arlo.  I carried Grace through and then I saw the shambles and crashed through the glass.  Once all three children were in bed with Rosie and Lui I climbed in. It felt safer to be together.\nLater I went down and got a torch.  I saw things smashed everywhere around the house.  One of the difficult things was the blackness.  We rang Wellington, Rosie’s sister Angie, and no one answered. Then we rang Nelson, Rosie’s brother, and he hadn’t felt anything.  I then knew it was not the main divide, but it was Christchurch.  We stayed in bed, waiting for the light to come.  It was good when the light came.  We didn’t know what had happened until calls came in from overseas. Strangely the landline started working again.’\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Brendan Evans conducted ten days after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.\nMy name is Brendan Evans, I am 16 and I live in Lyttelton. On the night of the earthquake I was in my room, which is a sleep out. \nI sort of lay in bed and waited for the earthquake to pass. I did not feel threatened. For the past week my school had been on camp at Temple Basin, and we just came home on Friday evening, so on Saturday night I was dreaming that I was still up at Temple Basin and that there was an avalanche. When I woke up I was still sort of half asleep and I thought it was an avalanche coming until I fully woke up and realised there was actually an earthquake and I just lay there and waited for it to pass. Then my Mum came bursting into my room after the earthquake and just to see whether I was OK and then I got up for a while and found a torch and listened to the radio for a bit but then I went back to bed about 5 o’clock. And slept through till 10 or 11.\nWe started school on Monday after a week of holidays, we had a week off because of the earthquake and the aftershocks.\nI don’t mind the aftershocks, it’s quite fun actually, it’s quite exciting sitting down and you feel a rumble and then the house starts to shake a bit, but I am so used to it now.\nIt is exciting because it is not every day that we feel earthquakes. But last week was not really different, I had holidays, went to see my friends, hung out in Lyttelton and went to parties and stuff. \nI feel exactly the same now, then I felt before the earthquake. I don’t think many young people were scared or felt any threat throughout the whole thing, I think it was mainly adults. Maybe because adults are parents and they worry about their kids and the house and stuff getting broken whereas for us it’s just the same thing really, just except the earth was shaking for a while.\nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton.  We are very grateful to Bettina and the interviewees for allowing their interview transcripts to be posted on QuakeStories.",

We leapt from bed and headed for our walk in wardrobe (small space – lots of framing). My thoughts we’re no…no…no… this can’t be happening. The noise was tremendous, things falling and breaking the roof creaking, glass smashing. We clung together as if our lives would end. As the shaking slowed we felt the floating motion, that we now know would have been our land floating on liquefaction.\nWe scrambled to find torches and the battery radio. Venturing out into the main part of the house I thought we would find fallen ceilings and broken windows, but miraculously things looked relatively normal. The fridge had walked across the kitchen floor and wine bottles had ejected from the cupboard and some smashed. The smell of red wine filled the air.\nA neighbour knocked on the door to ask if we were OK, and wondered why there was so much water about, had it rained heavily, no-one heard it raining. Several people from the street gathered to express their shock and one family jumped in their car and drove off for fear of a Tsunami. Was the quake at sea, on land, who knew. Minutes later they were back as the nearby bridges were unpassable.\nI tuned into the radio and it seemed forever before reports came through, buildings down in the city. Power out everywhere, water out too. After cleaning up a little we returned to bed… what else could we do till morning. Shakes and rumbles carried on.\nNext morning my brother sent a text saying that nearby houses could be evacuated and to come over if we needed. But the evacuation never happened.\nWe were caught with no drinking water so grabbed a container and walked to the Civil Defense Sector Post but there was no-one there, not realising that the hall was damaged. We later found CD out on Lower Styx Road and a nearby resident filled our container from his bore…bless him.\nLater that day still with no power and no water, ground still shaking and still feeling stunned I remember hearing someone mowning their lawn and it seemed so weird, as if nothing had happened!",

I was living alone.  In a moment of quiet I ran to my neighbours house in dressing gown and barefeet and he and I stood in the middle of the house where we thought we were safe trembling and frightened while constant aftershocks pounded us. I thought I was going to die. \nI tried desperately to manage over the next few months but by November I developed acute agoraphobia and couldnt get more than 1km from home only to neighbours and dairy across the road. I would start to panic driving or going too far from home. Had to resign from my job that I loved and go on a benefit which I find humiliating, although isnt it funny as I would never judge someone else in the same position.\nIn November I pleaded for help from every public health service (my doctor was great) and finally in April this year I was assigned a support worker to help me gradually get out and about. So the response was slow and as I waited for help I got worse and worse.\nI could no longer stay at home alone and needed to move across town, my neighbours house split in half and he was red stickered so I told him my situation and suggested we find something to rent together, it is working out well.\nIn the last 2 months I have managed to be driven by my support worker to the mall weekly,and I have to do a few blocks close to home planned drive twice daily to gain confidence and gentle exposure to being out and driving, regularly extending the length by mostly one block at a time once I am comfortable to move to the next step. It is a very slow and exhausting process. I am unable to get a haircut, go to the dentist and many other basic things that we take for granted. I havent been able to put gas in my car for 14 months now (jan 2012). There are many others struggling with the same sort of thing and children who are traumatised.\nI know there are so many people who have struggled and lost so much and in alot of ways Im very lucky.

        "text": "Miles away from Christchurch in Marlborough, it was a calm and quiet night. The nights were starting to get warmer and I had questioned whether my children still needed the heater on overnight. Although we all have our own rooms we had been sharing one room over the previous two or three months so we would only need one heater. Just after 4.30 am both of my children woke upset. It occurred to me that the room might be too hot so I got up to turn it down. As I did I realised it really wasn’t that warm in the room. Both of the children took a while to settle back to sleep and seemed unusually tense. Being that it was a weekend and we had planned a trip to Picton the next day I was keen to resettle them. I looked at the time on my phone a remember clearly seeing that it was 4.38am according to the display. I thought nothing more of it until the next morning when I awoke and turned on the news. An ice-cold shiver ran through my body when I saw the “breaking news” banner run across the screen, images of my home town lying in ruins behind it. That was what had woken my children and dozens of others I have since spoken to. What a shock to see what had happened to my beautiful home city, if you had of told me a day earlier that a quake would destroy one of our biggest cities, I, along with probabaly the majority of the country, would have assumed it would be Wellington. Noone saw this coming.\nOn February 22nd I was working from home when we felt a small tremor. The lights flickered on and off a couple of times which they did again sometime soon after. I had a client with me and we both thought it very strange that the lights should be affected by such a small shake. She looked at me and said “there goes Wellington”. It never occurred to us that such a major aftershock could hit Christchurch months down the track after they had subsided so much and the talk had turned from aftershocks to rebuilding. We were both on edge and although we had been talking before we both went quiet and the radio in the background seemed to take over. We both froze when we heard the news that a major shock had struck Canterbury with expected fatalaties. Both of us have immediate and extended family and friends living in Christchurch. She turned to me and told me to turn on the TV and we sat glued to it for the next two hours, watching horrified at the footage, waiting for a text or call to know the worst. Two hours later she got a message from a friend saying that her son and two grandchildren were ok but there was not much left of their home. The next day and a half seemed to drag on forever, waiting to hear whether my brother was ok. By the next morning with no news, watching the footage of ruined buildings and people being pulled from the rubble, my mother was beside herself. We were helpless, we had tried to contact him but to no avail. At about six o’clock that night there was a knock on mum’s door. I went to answer it, mum refused to leave the TV. There was TK, standing in the doorway! I don’t think I have ever felt so relieved in my life! I took him in to the house and mum leapt to her feet, turned white as a ghost and sat back down again bursting into tears. Even with the million questions running through our heads it was a very quiet evening, a feeling of relief ran through the household that night. \nChristchurch is still and always will be home. It will never be the same again, so much has been lost, but it will be beautiful again, and strong, and the heart of the city remains the same as it always was. Kia kaha Christchurch, may the future be greater than the past that was lost.",

        "text": "At 4.35am on September the 4th, 2010, my husband and I were shaken awake by the extreme rocking of our bed, loud rumbling through the floor and the creak and groan of our moving house. We rolled towards one another and embraced tightly as the shock began to turn to realisation. Within seconds we could hear the sounds of crashing coming from other rooms, particularly the kitchen, where our huge floor-to-ceiling pantry threw open its doors and jars and cans rained down onto the plates and glasses on the lower shelf. Large, heavy pot draws were thrown open.  Pot plants and ornaments toppled onto the floor. Several framed prints leapt off the wall smashing the glass, while others thumped on the walls, but stayed put.\nFor several minutes I cowered in our bed, too afraid to move for fear the roof would be the next thing to tumble. My heart was racing and I was hyperventilating. When I took note of our immediate surroundings I noted that the digital clock was not displaying; obviously the power was out.\nI called out to our adult son in the next door bedroom to check that he was all right. We found a torch and gingerly made our way down the hall to check the condition of the house. The kitchen looked as if an angry and very strong demon had been on a rampage. We didn’t dare step in there in the dimness as it was evident that many tiny pieces of glass littered the floor and it would take the full light of day to clean up.\nThe only words that seemed appropriate that morning were “shit” and “oh my god”, as we continued to tour the wreck of our house. The living room had wonky pictures on the wall and fallen knick-knacks. Spilled potting mix and broken plants lay as they had fallen from tipped and broken urns. Our huge older style Sony television had rocked and shifted position but not fallen. Dust and insulation material had leaked from the ceiling through down lights and the gas fire’s flue.\nAnother surprise was finding that the toilet had slopped a huge amount of water onto the floor and everything in our shower was now lying on its floor.\nOutside, the driveway had more cracks in it but we didn’t have liquefaction.\nIt was a miserable morning with no power and soon, no water. I huddled back in bed to listen to the transistor radio and was increasingly alarmed by reports of what had happened to our city. We had no emergency supplies and no camp stove, so it was a cold breakfast and then out onto the street to see what was happening in our area. We walked the local streets, talking to neighbours and strangers alike, trying to make sense of what had happened. A kind neighbour gave us a gas stove so that we could at least heat something. This single burner was all we had for a couple of days. My husband, Hugh had a bicycle, so was able to go farther than the rest of our household, to check out our broken city.\nBecause we had no supplies we got into the car and went in search of food basics. It involved driving for many hours on broken roads in bumper-to-bumper traffic to get bread, milk, batteries, eggs and hardest of all: butane canisters to keep our burner going.\nI quickly realized that we weren’t going to manage at home with no power or water, so we booked into a motel for two nights just to have the luxury of a shower and warm beds. After that we went back home as the power was back on though the water took several more days.\nWith no toilet, we had to rig up a bucket with rubbish bag inside or use a garden pit. Overnight I just used an icecream container and hubby used an old bottle.\nOnce water was restored we slowly returned to a kind of normal, though nothing felt the same. The whole city felt strange. Although no lives had been lost and everyone proclaimed Christchurch “lucky”, we were constantly on edge from powerful aftershocks day and night.\nAt our work, a hospital where my husband is an orderly and I am a nurse, we were constantly having to reassure our patients and it took our minds off our own worries for a time. Eventually we slipped into a sense of normalcy. The Boxing Day earthquake didn’t affect us too much.\nOn February the 22nd, 2011, while we were on Annual Leave, the powerful quake struck at 12.51 pm. We had been in the North Island earlier in the month and were enjoying a break from working. It was a fine day: Hubby and I had been in town in the morning wandering the Cashel Mall area and buying things at Whitcoulls. We had got home and had lunch. Hubby was reading on the couch and I was on the computer in the spare room. Suddenly the house shook violently and I reached out to steady the computer monitor which was wildly rocking. As the shaking continued my swivel chair threw me off the seat and I landed on the floor along with a cascade of knick-knacks and a potted plant from on top of the console desk. I screamed in panic and was shaking so badly I couldn’t get onto my feet so I crawled along the floor to see that Hubby was all right. We looked out the windows to find that liquefaction was welling up in several areas in our section and silty water was rushing down our street. Power poles were leaning drunkenly down the street. Inside our house, things had toppled again but nothing too serious. The power and water were knocked out and this time, they were out for two weeks.\nHubby and adult son spent hours shoveling liquefaction silt from our garden and driveway as our car was trapped in the garage. A spare wooden door that had been leaning up on a wall in the garage toppled onto our little Honda and scraped the paintwork all down one side.\nAll of our neighbours laboured similarly in their gardens cleaning up the mess. We got to know some of our neighbours quite well during this time.\nWe “camped” at home as best we could. Doors and windows were stuck open or closed. We could not close the bathroom off so had to rig up a sheet over the door in order to create some privacy there. We got into a routine of boiling up water and pouring it into the basin for daily washes. I managed to get another burner so that we had two that could run at the same time for water heating and washing. It was exhausting constantly keeping up with obtaining water, boiling water to drink and heating water for cleaning and cooking. Initially it was difficult to get water supplies but later a tanker started to park up daily in Aranui and we would go there to fill bottles. Later still, the local intermediate school got a supply on and we didn’t have to travel so far. The Aranui Primary School was the closest place we could go to wash our clothes and I did that many times over the weeks when water was out or just off intermittently in later weeks and months.\nWhen army trucks came through our area I asked one of the crews if they could help us with our back door which was jammed and couldn’t be secured. They sent over two guys who prized it open, shaved a whole lot of wood off the top and side and made it so we could lock it closed, at least.\nWe saw quite a lot of the army around the streets as they checked on residents, handed out bottled water and helped in many other ways to secure peoples houses. Later they delivered a chemical toilet to each house.\nOnce we were back at work we could shower there on a daily basis. Much later the local golf course at Avondale got the mobile shower unit which was marvelous especially on our days off. It was a massive truck with about 6 shower stalls and gas hot water – heaven! \nOur house was moving constantly with the aftershocks and with each one we found more cracks, more bricks loosening and more warping of floors and walls. Being a 45 year old house with a wooden floor and on piles meant we really felt each shock keenly. We also heard the house creak and crack which was worrying.\nThe June quake struck while we were at work. It was a miserable day and I was so shocked to have experienced yet another large shock that I became quite emotional and didn’t cope well at work.\nAs soon as we could leave I got into my car for the arduous journey home. The streets were clogged with bumper-to-bumper traffic and most of the traffic lights were out. My usual 20 minute journey took me two-and-a-half-hours. The streets in our neighbourhood were flooded with liquefaction and where in darkness due to outages so I crawled along in my little car not knowing if I was about to drive into a sink hole.\nFinally at home I found a terrible mess. The violence of this quake had thrown heavy furniture across the rooms and I spent a long time cleaning up the chaos. Digital clocks were all blinking showing that the power had been off and on again.\nThe June quake sealed the fate of our home, causing more cracking and more liquefaction. \nAfter months of waiting we heard that our property would be in the Red Zone. Our adult son had moved out in April and in July we had had enough of our cold and broken suburb and we arranged a rental in a modern townhouse in Hoon Hay which our insurance company paid for. It was so amazing to us to be away from all the east-side issues and only minutes drive or cycle to our work that we felt very lucky and very relieved. It took another few months before our insurance company and CERA made the settlement offers, but finally we had a sum of money that we knew we could spend and we immediately went house hunting in the surrounding suburbs. By December we found a modern, warm townhouse in Somerfield and after a short bidding war, we secured it.\nLife goes on but things remain. The aftershocks are not so numerous or as strong, but when they come I shake and feel scared. My heart rate soars and I hyperventilate for several minutes. I also startle very easily whenever there is a sudden noise or a truck rumbles by. These things will probably go on for years.\nRose\n\nOctober 2012.",

My husband and I were sleeping our campervan in Riverton, Southland, the ground moving woke us both up and immediately the mobile rang. Our hysterical daughter was under the bed with her twin sister, in absolute panic, unsure what to do. We were 8 long hours drive away, we calmed them and started driving, listening to updates on the radio on the long road back. I have never experienced a mother’s fear of isolation and helplessness like that long drive…I just needed to hug them and reassure them! \nThe whole feeling of the city at that time was relief that none had lost lives and we were all nearly jubulant that we, the people of Christchurch had survived the wrath of Mother Nature. Little did we know, worse was to come!\nFeb 22 will live long in my memory. Even though I write this just after the second anniversary, I can remember the acute feeling of total helplessness, we were subjected to a massive earthly jolt, shooting my daughter and I off our chairs in Cass Bay, Lyttelton. Our lunch landed on the floor, things fell all around, we were on the second floor and we honestly had the feeling it was the end. We clung to each other in the door way and were rooted to the spot, every time we even thought about trying to run there was another huge shake, the noise too was so scarey, overwhelming! \nMy husband in a surreal moment rang my mobile which just happened to be within arms reach and he could hear us crying and screaming as he was attempting to drive down Hoon Hay Rd, experiencing an apocolypic movie scene, with road gratings shooting into the air and the hard kerbsides and road surface buckling and bending in front of his eyes. He took a long time to make it back to us…experiencing licquifaction and boulders on the road trying to get home. \nMy other daughter was attending her first day at CPIT, she had run out of the building with other panicked students, one girl shockingly ran into the path of an oncomming car, the grand old Basicila building was tumbling to the ground in front of their eyes. There where huge tears, stunned, shocked silence and panic trying to phone, text or somehow talk and console others that were hurt.\nWe finally reunited after a very long winded journey, navagating huge boulders on Dyres Pass Road, offering help to others along the way, seeing stunned and very shaken citizens stumbling, panicked steps trying to get home, make contact with their loved ones, very nervous and anxious about ongoing aftershocks. \nThe traffic was so slow and poor Sophie was trying to find her way to a landmark we could recognise to pick her up. I shall never forget jumping out of the standstill car, half running, half walking down Brogham Street past the old church on the corner of Colombo Street, a police man shouting at me to cross over the road and not walk too close to the doyley like structure of the old stone church, its stained windows all like latice work, barely standing. I finally sighted her and ran to give her the biggest hug in the world, so happy, relieved we had all been spared.\nTwo years later, we are still near Lyttelton. We have been in New Zealand now for nearly four years, we have made some lovely friends and feel the experience has heightened our appreciation of life, our loved ones and lessened the need for material possessions or the silly fickle things in life. We love this land, we feel part of the community and we feel so sorry for those who lost loved ones they cherished. Christchurch will rise again, the people are strong and resilient….it will take time.",

        "text": "I wrote this on my blog the day I went in to the red zone:\n\nI normally try to make these posts mostly positive, but I’m afraid this one won’t be like that.  This one deals with the large elephant that has been hanging around our rebuild party and making a nuisance of itself: the red zone in the central city.  For over eight months it has been off limits to the residents of this city, so it has loomed large in a lot of our minds and taken on a mystique greater than the relatively small size of its street footprint.  I have seen pictures of it, people have taken video as they drive around in it, there have been numerous aerial shots taken and with each and every one the place I remembered has faded and ‘the red zone’ has taken on an almost mystical value.  The pictures show a place that is desolate, filled with wide open spaces where empty lot follows on the heels of empty lot and in between them buildings slump in unnatural ways. I was expecting a wide open wasteland, but the reality is quite different.\nIt was with great trepidation that I even went on this trip in the first place.  There has been an implication in some quarters that people who go in there are sick and indulging in ‘disaster tourism’ and while I didn’t feel like those were my reasons for heading in, I could see how it might appear to those who had no need or wish to go in.  As a related aside, there was a family on our bus who very clearly were there as disaster tourists and anyone who is thinking of going in for whatever personal reason, and is worried they may appear like disaster tourists, can rest assured that by far the majority of people are clearly not doing it for those reasons, and that it is quite easy to tell the genuine people from those tourists.  \nIt was a mostly silent and sober busload of people that pulled away from Cranmer Square and headed into the city.  The first place we came to that affected me was Victoria Square.  I’d forgotten, even though I had seen pictures, that the lanterns which had been put up for the lantern festival the weekend after February 22nd were still there.  The sight of them, faded, ripped and broken in some places really got to me.  I had been expecting to go to that festival and to be coming to that place so many months later and having such a vivid reminder of the way life just stopped so suddenly on that day was quite startling.  It set the tone for most of the way I felt on the rest of the trip – a strange sense of coming home mixed with a feeling that said, ‘what the hell is this place? Where did you put MY city?’\nMy mental picture of the red zone, gleaned from so many photos taken by so many different people, is of a place that is wide open.  In my mind, it is a place where the bulldozed holes run rampant and any remaining buildings dot a desolate landscape.  In reality it felt very closed in being in there – and not just because we were corralled in a bus.  The buildings are so much closer than in imagination or memory, and they loom a lot more than I had expected, their broken forms so much more real when .  The sudden ripping of the red zone from pictures and into reality diminished the image a lot, which was good in a lot of ways.  Anything off limits for too long becomes bigger than its reality so to bring it back down to size was a good thing – a lot of the mystique surrounding the area is gone for me now.  However, that diminishment also made it harder to bear. Instead of the distance provided by pictures and video, their perspective skewed perhaps by lenses and different positions, it was very confronting to have those buildings close in so much that it felt like if we could just take the windows out of the bus I could reach out and touch some of them.  It’s hard to explain just what it’s like to have your mental picture of a place suddenly changed like that, from something that is horrific but only imagined into something else that is different, no less horrific and all too real. It’s an odd feeling, and impossible to articulate. \nWhat I also found in there was that what had once been ‘my city’ – the bits I knew and felt at home in, has now been split into two cities.  One of those cities somewhat resembles the desolate wasteland of my imagination.  It’s not as open as I had expected, but it has lost many of the places that were significant to me.  Buildings and businesses that were touch points of the city I knew have been obliterated and in some cases it’s very disorientating to try and figure out what is missing and even what street you’re on.  So many familiar landmarks, things I never realised I used to navigate by, are gone. \nOn the other hand, my other city looks almost normal.   Looking east down Cashel Street, if you ignore the leaning Grand Chancellor in the background, and its enormous crane, and gloss over the fact that there are no people on the street you can almost think that it’s any city anywhere in the world, or that the city I knew and roamed around in is still up and running.  You can pretend, if you try hard enough, that the city is just quiet for that one day and that shoppers will be along to breath life into again any minute now.  That’s an illusion of course, and I’m sure at least some of the buildings will be gone next time we’re allowed to get into the city, but it was an oasis in the sea of destruction of the rest of the CBD.\nThen, of course, was the cathedral.  The bus stopped at three points along the way (the sites of the PGC building, the CTV building and the cathedral) but at the other two I felt like it wasn’t right to take pictures.  I have several personal reasons for that, but the cathedral feels different.  In a way it was really nice, in light of the news this week about the cathedral’s partial demolition, and the unexpected complicated swirl of emotions that brought up in me, to be able to get close to it and take a picture.  It’s a sad sight, but it did feel good to be able to say goodbye to it before anymore of it goes and I think that’s where I’ll leave this.  It was a sad day, and a challenging day but I’m glad I did it.",

        "text": "Entries from my blog after the September earthquake:\n\nPosted 4 September 2010, 11 am\n\nJust a quick note to say we’re ok\n\n7.1 earthquake in Christchurch this morning, and some major damage in some areas, but we were really lucky – we got shaken up a lot, and a few minor breakages (2 plates and one ornament is all we’ve found so far), but no real damage, and the house seems ok structurally. The cats slept through it all!\n\nOnly just got the power on an hour ago (yay, the internet’s back at last!), and still having a few aftershocks, plus they’re worried our water might be contaminated by sewerage (there are lots of lines broken across the city), so we’ve been told to boil drinking water, but otherwise everything’s ok.\nPosted 4 September, 9 pm\n\nIt’s been a weird sort of day\n\nWe were rudely awoken this morning at 4.35 am by violent shaking. H was already leaping out of bed and heading for the safety of the doorway (all those stories I told him about the last big earthquake I was in obviously stuck), and I was right behind him. The shaking was strong enough that I had to hold onto the bedstead to be able to walk the couple of metres to the door without falling.\n\nStanding in the doorway (and hanging onto it for dear life!) we could see the streetlights outside flickering on and off, and hear things falling all over the house, and the sound of breaking crockery. Each crash I heard I thought “there’s another insurance claim”. All the doors along the hallway were swinging wildly open and closed – really scary!\n\nWhen the shaking finally stopped (according to the earthquake drums it lasted about a minute, but it felt much longer!) and we’d calmed down a bit we switched on the lights (the power was still on at that stage) to survey the damage. Surprisingly, there was very little. Most dramatic was that all the recipe books had fallen off their shelf in the kitchen, and were spread across the oven, bench, and floor: (photo http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/040910earthquake.JPG)\n\nA few things had fallen off shelves, all the pictures on the walls were crooked, and a couple of plates that were sitting in the sink were broken (accounting for the sound of breaking crockery I’d heard) – a heavy jar had fallen off the windowsill onto them – but there was surprisingly little actual damage. The really weird thing was the things that hadn’t fallen over – a delicate china vase H inherited from his grandmother had turned itself round 180 degrees but was still sitting safely on the shelf, the tea and coffee jars that sit on the shelf next to the recipe books were still there, despite all the recipe books falling down, and a glass was sitting precariously on the edge of the coffee table but hadn’t fallen. And weirdest of all, the cats seemed to have slept through it. George came wandering out (I think more to see why we were up so early (and more importantly whether it involved breakfast) than out of any fear), and Saffy was fast asleep in her beanbag and only woke up when we turned on the light to check she was ok.\n\nWhile Christchurch gets earthquakes quite often, they’re usually tiny, and they’re usually not actually in Christchurch – we just feel the edge of earthquakes in other areas. So my first thought was that if it felt that big here, wherever the earthquake actually struck must be really bad. We turned on the radio to see if there was any news, but the announcer (in Wellington) was just commenting that she’d felt an earthquake, and wondering where it was. We were trying to re-tune to a local station when the first aftershock hit. It was quite a big one (though felt tiny compared to what we’d just been through!) and knocked the power out. Looking out the window, it was obvious the lights were out all across the city – we’re on the flat, so we can’t actually see the city lights from our place, but you always see a glow in the sky from the direction of the city centre, and there was nothing.\n\nAbout now I started thinking what a good idea an emergency kit would be… :-) It was pitch black, so I found my cellphone, and used the torch on that to find the gas lamp and a real torch. The torch turned out to have corroded contacts, so I couldn’t get it to work, but at least there was a fresh canister for the gas lamp, so we had a decent source of light. No radio though – I found a pack of the right size batteries, but there weren’t enough.\n\nThe aftershocks kept coming, so going back to bed wasn’t really an option. H tried, but every time he started to drift off there’d be another aftershock which woke him up again. I didn’t even bother trying – I just got dressed, pulled the beanbag into the doorway and sat there with the lamp and a book and tried to read between the rumbles. Dawn took a really long time to come!\n\nThere was a lot of traffic for so early on a Saturday morning, which puzzled me for a while until I realised that with the power out, there’d be alarms going off all over the city, so of course all sorts of business owners (and IT people!) would be going to check on their businesses. Plus of course people would be checking on elderly relatives and so on.\n\nWhen it was finally light we could properly check the house for damage. We found a few more things that had fallen over, but to our amazement still no real damage. I was starting to think maybe the earthquake hadn’t actually been as big as it’d seemed – maybe it was just the darkness that had made it seem bigger and scarier. But then, as everyone else in NZ started to wake up and turn on the news, my cellphone started getting messages from family and friends from all over checking if we were ok (thanks everyone by the way for thinking of us, and apologies if I couldn’t reply – the network got overloaded after a while and while messages were coming in, I couldn’t send any or phone anyone). That was when we realised that it was a lot more serious than we’d thought, and that Christchurch was the centre. We still didn’t know just how bad it was though – there’s very little damage around our area, so we assumed it would be similar across the rest of the city.\n\nI dug out the camping stove so we could boil some water for a hot drink, and we settled down to wait for the power to come back on. And waited, and waited, and waited… Finally it came back at about 10ish, and we could turn on the radio and TV, which is when we saw just how badly the rest of Christchurch had been hit. We were so lucky! Even though the epicentre was to the west of the city (in Darfield), it was the city centre and the eastern suburbs that sustained the most damage. I assume it’s something to do with the underlying soil – we’re on reclaimed swampland on this side of town, whereas the east has much more sandy soil. Whatever the reason, somehow we got away with trivial damage while whole walls were collapsing in other parts of Christchurch.\n\nThe rest of the day was so weird. Everything seemed so normal out here (except there were no planes taking off and landing because the airport was closed – oh, and the street lights stayed on all day – their timers must have been messed up or something), but on TV we were seeing pictures of the destruction in the central city, just a few km away. It was hard to believe we were in the same city as the one on TV where a state of emergency had just been declared, and search and rescue teams were digging through rubble searching for victims. The radio was telling us to boil drinking water and not flush the toilet – hard to remember not to do when everything seemed so normal. It would be easy to think it was just like a normal lazy Saturday if it wasn’t for the aftershocks jolting us (quite literally!) back to reality every so often.\n\nI still can’t believe it really. I think it won’t be until I’ve been into the city myself and seen the damage (all those beautiful old buildings gone! I glimpsed so many of my favourites on TV and on Stuff) that it will really sink in. \n\n(Here we go again, just felt another aftershock…)\n\nAs far as work goes, it looks like I’ll have an unplanned holiday for the rest of the week. The university has been closed until probably the 13th while they check the buildings are safe. They’ve already found quite a bit of damage, though nowhere near as bad as it could be – they’re estimating about $1.5 million. Term was supposed to start on Monday, so they’re delaying it by a week, and in the meantime staff have been told to stay home unless senior management call you in to help with cleanup (which will mainly be technical staff, I’m guessing – there’s been chemical spills in labs and things like that that will need specialists to deal with them).\n\nI don’t know how well I’ll sleep tonight – I’m utterly exhausted (I’ve been up since 4.30 after all!), but there’s still aftershocks every couple of hours, so it’ll be hard to stay calm enough to sleep, or to stay asleep once I’m there. \n\nBut really, we were so lucky, both H and I and the city as a whole. Nobody died, there were very few serious injuries, and most buildings are still standing. When you consider that this was a similar sized earthquake to the one that hit Haiti, we got off so incredibly lightly. That’s the difference between an earthquake in a relatively wealthy country with building standards designed with earthquakes in mind, and a poor country with almost none. \nPosted 5 September 2010\n\nState of emergency day 2\n\nAs predicted, we didn’t get a lot of sleep. There were only 3 or 4 aftershocks big enough to wake us, but they were also big enough to make it hard to go back to sleep afterwards. I didn’t really sleep properly until about 6 am, when it started to get light outside, which somehow made me feel safer (yeah, totally illogical, I know, but my brain was doing this weird connection along the lines of “it was dark when the first earthquake happened, so big earthquakes must happen in the dark, so when it’s light there won’t be a big one” and I couldn’t talk myself out of it), and I ended up sleeping through until nearly 10.\n\nAfter a late breakfast we decided to brave the outside world, and walked up to the wee supermarket up the road. We’d originally been intending to get groceries on Saturday, which of course we hadn’t been able to do, so we were starting to run low on a few things (like something for dinner that wouldn’t involve creating loads of dishes – we have to boil the water to do the dishes, so we’re trying to minimise the amount we need to do). The supermarket was open, though several shelves were empty, either because they hadn’t had any deliveries (so there was no bread or milk), or things had been damaged falling off the shelves (the bargin bin was full of slightly dented cans), or just because everyone in Christchurch suddenly realised their emergency kits were lacking a few things (so things like batteries were in short supply). The woman on the checkout told us the cleanup yesterday had been a huge job.\n\nOtherwise, the day’s been another surreally normal one. The aftershocks are pretty few and far between now, so we’re starting to relax a bit. The only real discomfort is that the weather isn’t great, and we haven’t got the fire going (just in case there’s another big aftershock) so it’s a bit cold. But we’re wrapped up warm (in fact, H is sitting watching TV in a sleeping bag) so it’s not too bad. Must be horrible for people with holes in their walls though. \nPosted 8 September 2010\n\nExhaustion and fear\n\nThe stress and lack of sleep is really starting to hit. Yesterday was probably my worst day – we had a couple of really big aftershocks at about midnight which really spooked me, so another night of very little sleep, and despite there being only a handful of aftershocks during the day, I was on edge all day, especially yesterday evening as it started to get dark again. After three days of feeling reasonably blazé about the aftershocks, suddenly my stomach was in a knot and I was jumping at the sound of cars going past. Yet today, despite being woken by one of the biggest aftershocks yet this morning (it was “only” 5.1, but was centred much closer to Christchurch and very shallow, so felt huge) I’m feeling really calm and relaxed again – probably (pause here for another wee aftershock…) because I was only woken a couple of times during the night so I got the closest thing to a proper night’s sleep I’ve had since before the earthquake. H, on the other hand, was fine yesterday but is feeling really anxious this morning.\n\nFear’s a funny thing. I’ve been terrified of earthquakes since 1991, when I was in Westport for an “earthquake swarm” – three 6.x eathquakes in the space of a week, with aftershocks for months afterwards. Like this one, there was no loss of life, and very few serious injuries, and the damage was much less because it was in a small town with mostly low wooden buildings. It may have just been the timing (I had just moved there a week before to start my first real job after university, so I was already feeling a bit anxious about my plunge into proper adult life), but they left me a nervous wreck, and ever since then the slightest tremor has always set my nerves jangling. Even going into the earthquake simulator at Te Papa, which I knew was completely controlled and safe, left me a bundle of nerves for about an hour afterwards.\n\nYet the earthquake on Saturday morning, ten times bigger than the Westport ones, while of course being incredibly frightening at the time, seems to have almost cured my fear of earthquakes. It’s like the worst has happened, and it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, so I can relax now. My first reaction to an aftershock is not panic, but instead veers between curiosity and boredom – “I wonder how big this one will be”; “Oh, that was a different type of shake than the last one, that was interesting”; “bother, not another one, I just sat down”; “I can’t be bothered going to the doorway, I’ll wait and see if it gets bigger first.” Not that they aren’t scary at times (especially the big ones – and some of the aftershocks we’re having are big enough that if they were independent earthquakes rather than aftershocks they’d be news stories in themselves), but it’s a more rational fear, not that total panic I used to have. Even the anxiety I was feeling yesterday was more about tiredness than actual fear.\n\nIt makes sense in a weird sort of way. When H was going through therapy for his anxiety disorder, they taught a technique called “task exposure”. The theory is that when you’re afraid of something, a lot of the fear you feel isn’t actually fear of the thing you think you’re frightened of, but of the feelings that fear brings (the old cliche is right: the only thing to fear is fear itself). You think about whatever frightens you, and you anticipate how frightening it will feel to encounter it, so you start feeling even more anxious. But if you actually expose yourself to the thing you fear, you realise that the fear you feel isn’t actually as bad as you’d imagined it would be, so it starts lessening your anxiety. And that’s kind of what’s happened to me. For all these years I’ve been dreading another big earthquake, and imagining how frightening it would be. But now I’ve been through a big one, and it wasn’t really that bad. It was scary, of course, but I survived. So now I don’t have to be frightened about how frightening it would be. Of course, ideally task exposure is supposed to be done in a controlled way, increasing the exposure in small increments, but that’s a bit tricky to achieve with earthquakes ;-)\n\nAnyway, life is slowly going back to normal. Or maybe it’s just that the abnormalities are starting to feel normal. Buses are running again (I never thought I’d feel so happy to hear the sound of a bus go past as I did yesterday morning when I heard the first one – it was so reassuring to know that things are starting to get back to normal again), and we had our first mail delivery yesterday. We’re still boiling drinking water, but we’ve got into a good system with that now: we fill the big stock pot with water and boil it for the prescribed 3 minutes, then whenever we want a hot drink we can just bring it to the boil again and ladle water into our mugs. We use the same pot of water to fill the sink to wash dishes, and have filled a bottle from it to keep in the bathroom for brushing our teeth (though I have forgotten a couple of times and used tap water – no sign of gastroenteritis yet though, so I think I got away with it). Although we’ve got running water in our part of town, we’ve been asked to conserve water while they’re restoring the supply to the rest of the city, so we’re not having showers, just washing in the basin (although I did have a quick shower yesterday – I couldn’t cope another day without washing my hair!), and we’re avoiding washing clothes.\n\nWe’ve been given a schedule of when staff are going to be allowed back onto campus to start cleaning up. They’re letting us on building by building, and we have to have a safety briefing first. Our building was supposed to be allowed in tomorrow, but they’ve now held us back until Friday because of this morning’s big aftershock, which has meant they have to re-check all the buildings for structural damage again. Participating in the cleanup is voluntary – we’ll be paid whether we go in and help or just stay home – but I think most of us will be wanting to get in and see just how bad the mess is. From the photos they’ve been posting on the university’s website, I’m expecting my office is going to be in complete chaos – I’ve got a lot of free-standing filing cabinets I don’t expect to be standing any more, and I hate to think what’s happened in our resource room with its shelves of books and stationery!\n\nThanks again everyone for the messages of support – it really helps to know everyone’s thinking of us. I got a lovely phone call from Nephew #1 on Monday night – he said if we were scared by the earthquakes we should go and stay at their house. \nPosted 10 September 2010\n\nAnother step towards normality\n\nThey let staff back onto campus today to start the cleanup now that all the buildings have been certified safe. But first we had to attend a safety briefing, and we all had to sign in and sign out so they knew exactly who was in which building in case of aftershocks. All very dramatic, but it’s nice to know management are so concerned about our safety (even if the concern is probably more about not being sued…)\n\nI was a bit worried about what I’d find in my office, because I’d seen the photos and videos of the damage in other parts of the campus, but I got off incredibly lightly – just one filing cabinet had fallen over. (photo http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/100910earthquake1.JPG) (The trays of videos sitting on the ground were there already – the cabinet they normally live in got damaged a few weeks ago, and we’ve been waiting to get it replaced)\n\nThere are quite a few cracks in the interior walls of the building, but we’ve been promised by the engineers that they’re not dangerous (I seriously hope they’re right!!!). Here’s my favourite one from my office: (photo http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/100910earthquake2.JPG)\n\nThere were about half a dozen of us from our department who’d made it in to work, so we teamed up and cleaned up all the offices of people who hadn’t been able to come in, and the common areas. It was weird – some offices were completely untouched while the office next door would be a complete mess. There was no way of predicting what you’d find when you opened a door. It took us all morning to get our department back to normal, plus to help out a bit with another department upstairs.\n\nEven though the damage wasn’t as bad as we’d imagined it might be, it was still surprisingly emotionally draining work, so once the basic cleanup was done we all headed home. Jenny and her husband offered me a lift home, but as we were walking to the car we noticed that a Chinese restaurant on the edge of campus where we’ve often had lunch was open. We decided we needed a treat, and went in for lunch, and it turned out to be exactly what I needed – it was so incredibly normal being in there, just like it was an ordinary work day. Yet another assurance that life will return to normal eventually. \nPosted 20 September 2010\n\n25 hours and 58 minutes\n\nWe actually had a whole day without an aftershock yesterday! According to geonet here was a 3.4 at 10.32 on Saturday night, then nothing significant until 12.30 this morning, when we had a 4.6 (which actually woke me up – normally I’ve been sleeping through everything less than a 5, but it was quite shallow and went on for a long time). Perhaps the end is in sight?\n\nLife has been getting back to normal in other ways too. I’ve been back at work for a week now, and the students are back this morning, so it’s feeling like an ordinary day. Last week was a bit odd – it was really hard to get back into the rhythm of work. Probably just another side-effect of stress and tiredness – everyone I talked to was feeling the same way. If it’s possible for an entire city to suffer from depression, I reckon that’s what happened last week. The first week after the earthquake everyone was busy responding to the emergency, but by the second week the adrenaline was running low and everyone was just tired, anxious, and having trouble concentrating – basically depressed. It’s not surprising, really – even if you’re not all that scared by the aftershocks, you still get that jolt of adrenaline every time one hits, and having that much adrenaline in your system for such a long time isn’t great for your mental health! But after a reasonably quiet weekend, seismically speaking, everyone (including me!) seems so much more awake this morning and ready to get into it.\n\nI’ve been into town a few times now, and it’s both better and worse than I expected. If you went by the pictures on TV, you’d think the whole city centre is devastated, and it’s not. There are plenty of streets where there was no damage, or nothing worse than a few broken windows, which are rapidly being replaced. But every so often you see a damaged building – some with just a few bricks crumbling from the facade, others where whole walls have collapsed, and some that have already been bulldozed and the rubble removed, so there’s just a gap and you’re trying to remember if there was actually something there before. Then there’s the buildings which look ok from the outside, but have a red notice on their door (the council inspectors attach a coloured notice to buildings once they’ve checked them. Green means safe to enter, yellow means restricted entry (i.e. the owner can go in and retrieve their belongings, but definitely not open for business), and red means absolute no go.) And there’s cordons everywhere, so navigating around the city centre is a bit of a challenge – you start to go down a street and it’s closed off, or the road is open but the footpath is closed. There’s moments of dismay and delight as you find out what businesses have survived: Liberty books is open (yay!) but further along the block Smith’s is closed (majorly – the building has lost part of its upper floors) but planning to reopen in a new location (yay!).\n\nWe had our first post-earthquake meetup on Tuesday night (it’s funny how there’s this whole “this is the first time I’ve done x since the earthquake” feeling to so many things – even something like getting into a lift feels like an achievement :-)).\n\n We’d originally cancelled the meetup, not knowing if anything would be open, but the Dux reopened pretty quickly and enough people were keen to have a meetup that we uncancelled it. I reckon we should cancel meetups more often, because we had a better turnout than we’ve had for ages :-) It was a great night, and nice to feel like we were doing something normal again.\nPosted 9 October 2010\n\n... Still getting aftershocks – they said in the paper a couple of days ago that we’ve had over 1300 so far. We’re only getting two or three a day now, and most of them are small enough that you only notice them if you’re sitting still, but there’s still the odd largish one. There was a 4.4 that woke me up on Thursday morning (H only woke up enough to mutter something about George wanting to come in, and when I said it wasn’t George scratching at the door, it was an earthquake rattling it, he rolled over and went back to sleep…) No matter how many we have, they still give you a bit of a fright. ...\nPosted 12 December 2010\n\n... It doesn’t feel much like Christmas yet. There’s been the usual round of Christmas lunches and things at work, but in a half-hearted sort of way. I think everyone just wants to get this year over with – it’s been a pretty horrible one all round at the university, what with all the redundancies, then the earthquake, and then Pike River… Next year has GOT to be a better one!  ...",

        "text": "Written 18 March: Our pre-quake routine has not yet returned, and is not likely to for some time.  Our post-quake routine is becoming well-established, and almost seems ‘normal’ now.\nI sometimes car-pool with a colleague, and on our way home the other day we spoke about how we have a new, new normal.  We had developed one after September, and now we are developing another.  It’s incredible how quickly you adapt, and how quickly things that would have knocked you for six a few weeks earlier now seem as if they have always been.\nSome of this is because this is our second round in the ring.  Post-September, we’d lived through thousands of aftershocks, had driven past uncountable cordons, and detoured around countless road closures.  We’d seen damage on so many buildings that it no longer surprised or shocked us.  It is different this time, in that we’d thought we were on the road to recovery, and now have to start all over again, but on a much larger scale.\nBut, piles of rubble no longer surprise us.  Saddens us, yes.  Surprises us, no.\nFinding that another beloved building has fallen, or been pulled down, or has been red-stickered as unsafe no longer surprises us, though it does break our hearts.  Increasingly, too, we are frustrated and angered by the flattening of our central city, often without notice to the owners or tenants of buildings.  The city’s heritage and history are being pulled down without a chance to salvage what is salvageable.\nCordons are commonplace.  So are the tanks and military personnel and police officers patrolling the roads in and out of the central city.  By now we’d be more surprised by their absence than we are by their presence.\nAnd the signs!  Prior to the earthquake, I’d complained for the last few months that Christchurch was becoming Sign City in preparation for the Rugby World Cup which was to have been partly held here in about six months.  Not all signs were related to the RWC, but many were in preparation for the thousands of visitors the games would have brought us.  Now, there are more signs than ever, but of a very different nature.  \nSigns advertising free water, or reminding us to boil all water, or urging us to sanitize our hands prior to touching the taps on the water tank.  Signs advertising welfare centres, hot showers, laundry centres, and places to charge cell phones or laptops.  Signs offering free food.  Signs posted by bereaved pet owners looking for Fido or Kitty.  Signs telling all passersby that WE ARE OPEN.  Signs alerting drivers of closed roads and detours or of work crews.  Signs asking drivers to PLEASE SLOW DOWN.\nAnd the most unnecessary sign of all, perhaps: Uneven Surface.  Is there anywhere that the surface isn’t uneven?!\nIt’s been just over 3 weeks now since the big shake, and the amount of work that has happened in that time period has been nothing short of incredible.  We are no longer surprised at the number of work crews on our streets; they have worked night and day to make our roller coasters – er, roads – or at least the main routes – passable again.  By ‘passable’, I mean just that – quick fixes and patchwork to make the roads passable; a year ago we’d be raising the roof with the shape the roads are currently in; now, we are impressed with how much the crews have accomplished to get them to this standard.\nWater is restored to nearly all the city; we got ours yesterday (Thursday 17 March), although we then lost it again for a short while, and will not have hot water til next week as our cylinder has to be replaced.  Our neighbour’s hot water cylinder survived, and as they’re going out of town this weekend we have a key to their home, in order to have hot showers.  It feels to us that we’re incredibly lucky, as we are no longer enslaved by the ritual of sourcing water every day; do you have any idea how much water it takes to brush your teeth?  Flush a toilet?  Fill a sink to do dishes?  Water houseplants?  We do.\nGetting the water back on was such a big deal that my husband texted me at work to tell me, and I told the people with whom I was in a meeting.  Yay!  To get home and find that it had gone off (briefly, thankfully) was heart-wrenching, as it was then the start of a 3-day weekend and we knew it’d likely be at least Saturday before the work crew returned, as they had certainly earned a day off to attend the memorial service.\nIt’s not surprising to find water pooled on the side of the road, or streaming downhill, a burst pipe making itself known.  Although most of us now have water – and power – we are reminded regularly to conserve it, as supply lines are fragile.  Those in the eastern suburbs whose water supplies have been back on for a while, know this all too well, and the flow trickles to a stop from time to time; even those in the western suburbs are not totally unaffected, and getting a plumber within a week is considered ‘lucky’.\nTraffic remains a bother, especially at peak travel times at the start and end of the workday.  Many people have altered their work hours, to avoid the worst of it.  Leave home at 7am and travel through a ghost town.  Leave at 730am and take 2+ hours to do what would normally take 30 minutes.  You travel far out of your way in order to make better time, cutting down this back road and that one, never sure where you’ll be blocked or detoured by a road closure.\nEverything has changed.  Something as simple as wanting to go to the shop to purchase a few items leaves you scratching your head, wondering who is open, travelling first to this place and that, and typically ending up on the western side of town as so much on the eastern side is just closed.  Four weeks ago, we had 3 grocery stores within 10 minutes of home; now, we have only the one just down the hill, with its limited supplies and higher prices.  To buy groceries, everyone in these three or four suburbs must travel at least as far as the Moorhouse Pak-n-Save or Countdown, which is normally a 20-minute drive but can be doubled now.\nThat’s another thing!  Speed!  I doubt many have come close to touching the speed limit for over three weeks now.  You’d be pretty foolish to even try.  Even the more passable roads suddenly drop or rise, or have a bump or a crack you just can’t see til you’re on it.  How can roads develop such big humps or hollows in them without breaking?  Typically, you travel at about 20kph, maybe 30kph if you’re on a very familiar road – and by familiar, I mean one you’ve travelled many times in recent days – and even then you have to come to nearly a stop quite often.  That’s on the main routes; venture off the main routes onto side roads and you realise that the work crews haven’t been able to devote as much time or resources to these roads yet.  It’s impossible to drive them without wanting to engage 4WD.\nBut yeah, shops are a big thing.  I know we’re lucky in that we can even get to a shop less than a month after a quake, and that we were pretty much able to within a couple days of the quake; it could have been a lot, lot worse.  But, barring an even greater disaster, you are still left wanting the familiar, wanting to be able to buy your groceries in the same shop as always, wanting to go down to the pub quiz on a Wednesday, wanting to go to a favourite restaurant.  Everything you want to access is pretty much closed, with only a few exceptions – mostly on the western side of town.  The talk is that for many of the closed businesses, it may be months before they reopen – if ever.\nThere are so many things I could write, which I keep thinking about and then forgetting as I go off on one tangent or another.  I could write, for example, about how the Hotel Grand Chancellor seems to be on just a bit more of a lean every time I see it; it’s one of the most identifiable buildings on our skyline, and it just looks like it’s going to someday topple over.\nI could write about our new vocabulary.  The term ‘munted’ had been around a while, but it’s suddenly become ‘the’ word for describing something that’s been absolutely devastated.  You don’t have to ask the meaning when someone says something such as ‘my house is totally munted’.  You just know.\nAnd if you never thought portaloos and chemical toilets could ever be an acceptable topic of conversation, try going into a disaster zone.  Not only are they acceptable topics, they are widely spoken about, wished for, decorated, and stolen.  For those digging holes in the garden, there is even a website where creative sorts can show off their outdoor toilet.  One of our most popular ‘jokes’ these days is along the lines of ‘You know you’re in Christchurch when you and the cat fight over the best hole in the garden.’\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                        And terms like liquefaction have entered our daily vocabulary.  I can’t imagine a soul in Christchurch who hasn’t come face to face with it in one form or another – as liquid, as mud, as silt.  More than 200,000 tonnes of it – at least 7 or 8 times more than in September – has been shovelled out of gardens, out of homes, out of parks, and off streets.  The Student Volunteer Army and Farmy Army are owed debts of gratitude we can never repay.\nI could write about how good it feels to look across the mouth of the river and see the lights on in New Brighton; for many days, they weren’t.  I could write about how our friend told me he felt like a kid with a new toy when he finally had his power restored late last week, or about how dark the roads still are as many lights have not been replaced, or how dark the hill is as many homeowners have vacated their properties.\nOr about the day last week when I ventured down to the public pool’s changing rooms to have a shower.  I later joked that you have to leave your modesty or a guard at the door, as there was absolutely no privacy within the changing room.  I had gone down in the early afternoon and was the only person present, and frankly just didn’t care if anyone walked in on me; I was having a SHOWER.  Even better, I was having a WARM shower, as some kind of rigging had been set up to allow local residents this luxury, once taken for granted.  My husband and I have been very lucky, in that we can shower at my workplace; I have also been able to do the laundry there, and dishes a time or two.  Otherwise, we’d have had to go to one of the communal shower or laundry facilities that have been set up.\nOr about really wanting to buy a burger and fountain coke at McDonalds or Burger King.  BK is pretty much not an option at the moment, as only one or two of its stores are open.  McD is open in some places, but for a while were only serving bottled drinks.  One of my staff stopped at McD for me yesterday and – hey, here’s a surprise! – brought me back a coke on ice when I had expected a bottle.  Woo hoo!  He told me that they had a tank set up outside their restaurant, presumably to service the drinks machine and ice-maker, but at that point I didn’t really care; I drank with wild abandonment.  :-D\nAh yes, in this ‘new normal’ world, one can also go down a hill and shake hands with the future King of England, Prince William.  How crazy is that?  Of course, yesterday I was more excited about having water than about possibly having a chance to get a glimpse of Wills!  But, today, having water is now ‘old news’, and I have shaken the hand of the man who will be king!  Of course, I would rather have my city back; I would rather he have not had a reason to walk through our street, or attend a memorial service for our lost.",

        "text": "Lest we Forget: Christchurch  and its People   –  an outside view\n\nMy mouth is bone dry. I draw back from the fissures in front of me as a wave of vertigo threatens, the cracks in the asphalt appearing like veins on the back of some monstrous hand. Before me only the roofline of the home clinging to the edge of the cliff is visible, its chimney lurching sideways at a sickening angle, the house hanging over the dizzying drop below. \nI am in Clifton Terrace high above the road to Sumner in Christchurch.  It is the end of July and the road has only just reopened nearly five months after the huge February aftershock. I can see why, it must have been choked with debris and danger and I am standing on what was once the parking area and garaging for several homes. I lower my camera and walk downhill trying to imagine the sheer terror experienced by anyone who had been in those houses at lunchtime on February the 22nd. . I see the remnants of a deck hanging over the stunning views many metres below. It is eerie, the broken remains of once elegant terracotta pots and their plants still lie there as though stopped in time, it reminds me of the tales of the Marie Celeste, the people mysteriously missing.  A final glance down the banks reveals a delicately wrought gate swinging crookedly in the breeze- it leads to nowhere – the house has gone. \n I live in Blenheim and I have come to Christchurch to house sit and look after dog Max for my daughter and her fiancé while they take their first escape since last September from all the stress. They are in Melbourne and I want to understand what it is like for people here long after the initial dramatic events when the adrenalin rush has stopped cold and the reality of simply coping from day to day has become the norm. \nNow I am on the steps of the Bridge of Remembrance at the foot of Cashel St. right at the edge of the Red Zone in the CBD.   They are cracked and askew but amazingly enough the arch still stands. Little could the veterans have envisaged that one day this memorial would frame a different dead of their city and the wholesale destruction of its heart. Through the arch the doomed Hotel Grand Chancellor is clearly seen.  Immediately next door on the Avon’s banks a small crowd watches the demolition of the DTZ building. Only a fence separates us from Oxford Terrace and the foot of the Mall and the giant crane operating the wrecking ball. There is an eerie silence- no excited buzz – these are people watching yet another part of their history turning into rubble before their eyes. The wrecking ball, delicately positioned, drops and is followed by the cracking and rending of floor after floor and the debris tumbles down followed by a suffocating explosion of dust. It starts to clear and an extraordinary sight greets us. Hundreds and hundreds of sheets of paper drift down like giant confetti. \nOne of the reasons I want to walk and drive across the city is that so much of the television media attention has focussed on the CBD and the eastern suburbs. There is no question that these areas were the worst hit and they also made for the most dramatic images.   While there have been some excellent stories showing the courage and grit of individuals and groups there has also been a disturbing  concentration  of  people speaking out who appear to expect the government, the council, the insurance companies  and everyone else to put their lives back exactly as they were before September 2010.   They feel “neglected” they say and that they know it “is because they are poor”   and I want to see how other suburbs in the perceived slightly better off areas are coping as well as the admittedly devastated eastern locations.  It is harmful coverage as word is trickling back to Christchurch people that there are instances of outside reaction becoming “well they have had a tragedy but really it’s time to get over it” \nSt Martins where I am staying is a perfect example of many suburbs in Christchurch. Just before my family left for Melbourne they were stricken to learn that their two story town house in the orange zone is almost certainly irrepairable and that there is great uncertainty over the land.  Nearby, builders found that they had to go down an incredible seventeen metres to find solid rock. \nJust a minute away was the New World and shopping mall. It is now a hideous flattened wasteland with only a lonely sign to mark it was ever there. Across the road a line of neighbourhood small shops and services is abandoned.  St Martins has lost its whole neighbourhood centre – the place to shop, meet friends, have a coffee, pick up a treat from the baker, buy a tonic for that cough from the chemist. They have lost everything. \nSt Martins also waited a long time for the portaloos – digging holes in the back yards.  There was no student army for the liquefaction, neighbours dug – shovelled – carted for days to get the stuff out to the road edges When someone with power connected cooked a roast they made extra dinners for fellow diggers. No helicopters from those wonderful people in Rangiora brought hot meals and water and bucket toilets to suburbs like St Martins. I never saw an interview in similar areas- they all just got on with it. The roads were like a sea of greasy grey waves. \nAnother day and I am heading for Lyttleton.  On the way I need a few supplies and petrol. I pull into a large shopping area and see various stores operating. Spotting a huge Countdown supermarket I pull in and think how great the parking is.   No wonder – it has been shut down for months – weirdly there is one lone man sitting inside the doors at a table and he shakes his head. What could he be doing there?   Now I look for gas and find how difficult this is too, the first and second gas stations I come to are still inoperable and I finally find a third open and working.  As I enter the tunnel I find that for the first time I feel rather nervous .It is such a long tunnel and I can feel the tons and tons of rock pressing overhead. I realise that I am hunching my shoulders and pulling in my neck like a nervous turtle.  . However I tell myself over and over it is a tribute to the engineers of the 1960’s as the tunnel withstood all the recent seismic events.  I repeat this like a mantra until I gratefully see daylight at the end. \nLyttleton is almost unrecognisable.  I have to pick my time carefully to cross the road as there seems to be an endless chain of huge demolition trucks thundering by. The last vestige of the famous Timeball has gone, the main street with its funky bars and cafes is now mostly an avenue of wire and boards with the trucks churning the debris into their voracious throats.   I feel apprehensive as anyone does with a camera.  Would I be regarded as something of a voyeur?  Would I be resented?  On the contrary everywhere I go in Christchurch people are so friendly and eager to share their experiences.  A lady tells me that her hundred year old wooden house survived but a neighbour’s brick house collapsed and took a out a wall.  She says that it is a fantastic community here and they are positive about the rebuild of their charming township. I am coming to see that the sharing of the experiences is a great part of the healing process for the people of Canterbury. \nThis morning I jolt awake to a 5.1 aftershock. It has made the insurers very jumpy yet again. In five days I have experienced three aftershocks. There will be many more we do not feel.  Cantabrians are heading towards 7000!  This is the day I venture into New Brighton, Bexley, Avonside, Richmond and some other areas unfamiliar to me.  Road works are so extensive that long detours are often necessary following endless arrows.  You can see the immense amount of work already done on the roads but it is just overwhelming to find how much is still to be achieved.  A glance down side roads shows street after street with silty surfaces and instead of trees the avenues consist of portaloos.  I hear that they are due to be removed from the city soon but it is astonishing to see streets from Cashmere to the sea still prickled with them like intrusive cacti.  Stopped at a red light I look to my right and there is yet another undulating wreck of a local corner shopping centre \nWalking along Avonside Drive near the deserted high school, the road and footpath are still extensively damaged and I have to pick my way carefully.  An impressive brick home is cut off by a driveway so tortured by the movement of the quakes that it is one of the images most expressive to me of their sheer violence.  A house tilts at an impossible angle. I walk around New Brighton  and the quaint  old buildings  I once photographed  are an anonymous space and across the road the old blue Ozone House  with the wonderful stained glass windows looks out with a blind  wooden stare. \nUnlike Europeans we Kiwis are obsessed with home ownership. We love our own patch.  We go into huge debt and make the biggest purchase of our lives with little hesitation. This is our sanctuary, our refuge.  We close our front door and shut out the cranky boss or the lousy traffic and gratefully receive jammy hugs from our offspring. We kick off our shoes and pour a beer or a glass of wine.  We are home.  Throw cataclysmic events into the mix, take away or damage our homes and there are profoundly Stygian effects on our national psyche.  The cave is no longer safe.  \nWalking along in Richmond I pause at the Methodist Church. The main building appears fine but an adjoining wing is a complete wreck. Standing in the centre is the freakish sight of one perfect stained glass window.  I sit next to a lady having a quick lunch on a bench in front of the church. She is a practice nurse and tells me of the huge amount of stress she sees with couples having to share their homes with elderly parents.  I think of the inevitable tensions.  Many of us in countries in the west are not so good at sharing our homes with different generations.  After the first events when everyone did their very best, months later problems arise.  Parents criticizing their adult children over the upbringing of their children.  Both parties longing to regain their space and their privacy.  They all want their old life back and it may be months and years before this eventuates in a new form. \nI have been driving and walking for hours and am gasping for my caffeine fix. It seems a trivial yearning when surrounded by such scenes but this too is something sorely missed by people I meet. Oh for Oxford Terrace and its great cafes, my last visit there was on a wonderful summer’s night near Christmas. As the sky deepened into that magic blue, lights twinkled everywhere, a riverside delight. There is nowhere really to go and when you find someone open you tumble through the doors insane with gratitude, wanting to hug the barista as your lungs sweep in the best aroma in the world – the scent of freshly ground coffee beans.  I have travelled out to Sumner, once a stunning sea side drive now a lopsided avenue of ugly containers holding back the rocks.  At the little coffee shop a lady sits beside me and I find that she has been recruited by Fletchers who have a major part in the city’s rebuild.  They have told her to expect at least five years employment.  Rejuvenated, I meet people with a cheerful and positive air and a young man tells me he has moved into three different rental properties after severe damage to the first two, but he is staying in the area as he so enjoys living here.   \nThe cliffs loom over Sumner a brooding menace in their proximity to the town.  Great piles of rock are glimpsed behind the container fringe, and some small side roads end in houses the sad victims of the plunging six thousand year old cliff faces. No one dreamt of this happening before, the occasional rock fell over the years  but the February quake was ten times greater in force than the September original quake. It created fissures hundreds of metres long and ripped houses apart. Fifteen metres of cliff front plunged in mighty plumes of dust and rocks the size of dumpsters. \nMax and I settle in front of the cosy fire grateful for warmth. We can’t go through the twisted front door but we don’t suffer draughts and fungi growing on mouldy carpets. That night jumping awake after a small shake I can’t get back to sleep. I find myself worrying about all those road and service workers spending endless hours on the roads. Clouds of the fine dust from the silt rose around them today as I made my way around the diggers.  What will be the long term effect of inhaling such contaminated   dust?  \nI take a friend today out to Oxford to lunch at Jo Seager’s restaurant and cooking school.  I want to give her a break out of the city. She lives in Bishopdale a western suburb regarded as lightly damaged. I confidently pull in to a large gas station to find it too has been shut down for months.  . A small one nearer her home is open but has only just resumed business.  She shows me her house and while it can be repaired there are still long cracks and uncertainty about a small pool. To our astonishment, Jo’s restaurant is booked out with dozens of other Christchurch refugees all having the same idea. We go on a waiting list and later enjoy a delectable lunch. As we return to the city a little sleet and dropping temperatures make us aware of a bad weather forecast and I drop my friend at home and go into Durham Street and the city centre.  As I gaze through the fence to the city heart the wide completely empty streets evoke intense sadness – I expect to see tumbleweed slowly bowling across the road and John Wayne appearing hand on gun in a rerun of High Noon.  \nNearby I am surprised to see that a tourist bus is back expelling eager gamblers at the doors of the brightly lit Casino. Inside only the lift well appears damaged and the players haven’t changed.  The tables are full mostly of Asian men intensely focused and oblivious to all around them. In front of the poker machines the same blank faces hope for the rattle of the big payout. Outside again and it is quite bizarre as  immediately butted against the wall of the Casino the familiar wire fence guards the hungry machinery and the rubble of another destroyed street.  A few blocks away and a roof of St Luke’s is crouching without walls in a sad genuflection.  It is getting dark now the sky fierce and glowering and I pause to read the sign on a fence darted with dying flowers. It asks all who look at this house to remember that these apartments were once their homes. The two story former grand old wooden house is accordion pleated and has wheezed out its last sigh. \nIt is Monday morning and the family are due back today and I should be on my way home. I draw back the curtains and am transported to Finland!   I am sure Donner and Blitzen will appear and delight us. It is all very beautiful until I realise my car is blocked in and deep in snow. All flights are cancelled.  Max is stuck with me and regards me with horror when I let her out. One paw in that mysterious freezing whiteness and she (yes, she)!  darts inside and goes round and round the couch so I can’t put her out again.  Some quick wit on twitter says it is “the icing on the quake.”  The family staggers exhausted through the door at midnight on Tuesday after miserable hours spent in airports and Max greets them with ecstatic slobber. I can’t get out until Wednesday lunchtime when I am finally on my way. \nPicking carefully through snow and slush piled roundabouts I find the northern exit now open and it takes me past the Christchurch Art Gallery. This ice queen of rippling glass stands tall surrounded by her fallen subjects. She proves brilliant engineering can design safe buildings.   None of us can forget the images sent all over the world when this was the temporary civil defence centre. A weary mayor Bob Parker, day after day telling us news that only seemed to become worse  .Grim heads of police and essential services updating us every few hours, the death toll rising and the remarkable work of the two signers to the deaf. \nWhat do I take away from these ten days? I have travelled from the broken winged Sign of the Takahe to New Brighton, from Hornby to much stricken Kaiapoi, Oxford to Akaroa, Mt Pleasant to Bishopdale and Belfast and many points in between.  First is the resilience of the people of Canterbury and their humour and courage.  Second, the feeling of being absolutely overwhelmed by the magnitude of this catastrophe. No suburb, no man, woman or child, neither rich nor poor and all those in between has escaped the stress, the fear, the anxiety for their futures. Third, the enormity of the undertaking for the recovery of roads, the essential  services and community centres  the schools and sportsgrounds .is way beyond what I had imagined nearly a year down the track. Officials are talking ten to twenty years. \nAs I enter the outskirts of Blenheim, the sun shines, there are no snow bound or damaged roads. Houses are not fractured and garden walls not tumbling on to the footpaths. The only portaloos are for the pruners in the vineyards. I feel as though I am in a parallel universe, part of some sci-fi movie and yet the reality of Christchurch is only a few hundred kilometres down the road. \nAt home later I hear Kaiapoi reels as it finds that one in five homes can never be rebuilt.  The good news for Christchurch is the release of the draft plan for the rebuilding of the city It is the distillation of over 100,000 ideas submitted by residents. It is exciting, innovative, fresh and very green .and a glimpse of a future shimmering with promise. Cantabrians I salute you. We will not forget.",

        "text": "Here is what I wrote in response to questions from the Community Broadcasters’ Association of Australia about our community access radio station’s experiences after the September 2010 earthquake.\n\nNicki Reece\n\nStation Manager\n\nPlains FM 96.9\nSeptember 2010\n\n1.How badly damaged was the station from the earthquake? Was there any structural damage to the station’s building or damage to equipment in the studios? \n\nAfter a couple of hours checking that our families were all OK I turned on Plains FM at 7:15am on Saturday 4th September and heard the familiar sound of Samoan voices. I was shocked and amazed that the Samoan team were on air broadcasting their usual Suifofoga O Samoa programme.  I was sure that they would have stayed at home and the station’s silence detector would have kicked us over to the BBC World Service. But no! Our intrepid PIs had been on air live since 6am (an hour and a half after the big quake). I couldn’t get through to them on the phone and I was terribly concerned about their safety if the building had been damaged. \n\nI drove to the station through streets that were eerily deserted, even in the central city where we are located on the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology campus. Robert, David and Lilly were sitting in the studio looking pretty relaxed until the building rattled with a big aftershock! They were determined to carry on broadcasting however, so my husband and I scooted around the building to check for damage. Structurally there was nothing apparent. A monitor had hit the deck, as had a shelf of CDs and sundry unimportant items but otherwise we were on-air, with power and water intact. Amazing!\n2.How has programming been affected? Have there been any changes in program content related to the earthquake and its affect throughout the community?\n\nMy next concern was that what was being broadcast was accurate and helpful. So I fed information through from the City Council website and Civil Defense to the Samoan broadcasters on air to translate for their community. Because of the tsunami that hit Samoa last year people were terribly worried the same would happen here and were fleeing from the eastern suburbs nearest to the coast. We were able to reassure them that there had been no tsunami warning and to stay put.  \n\nOur broadcasters and staff definitely felt a sense of responsibility to be on air over the next difficult few days to help disseminate key messages from Civil Defense. Luckily we were just outside the CBD police cordon. Broadcasters also wanted to reassure listeners and buoy up their spirits. \n\nA few programme makers did take a break over the days that followed as the significance of this event hit them emotionally, or they had to deal with damage to their home and contents. \n\nEveryone was suffering from sleep deprivation due to the aftershocks that just kept coming so when the Polytech evacuated the site after some major shudders above 5 on the Richter scale on Wednesday 8th September I made the call that my staff and live broadcasters would go too. \n\nOur building would probably have been OK but I didn’t want to take the risk and I felt we all needed a chance to just be at home with our families for a day. \n3.Tell us about the station’s evacuation. Despite the stress of it all, judging from the YouTube clip it looks like you still managed to have a sense of humor about things!\n\nThere are quite a few things to consider when you decide to shut shop. Luckily we had lots of pre-recorded shows already in the system so it was a matter of getting in touch with our live to air presenters by phone, and canceling some pre-record bookings the next day. We also put messages on Facebook, Twitter and our website, and a big sign on the front door with a mobile contact number to call. \n\nI took my car-less colleague Edward home and my husband suggested we make a small detour to check out our friends’ QuadChilla for a bit of light relief. Think of a chilly bin on wheels with a handlebar on the front and a small engine on the back!! It was great to have a laugh after 4 days of stress – hence the YouTube clip. However our thoughts did not stray far from those Cantabrians who were dealing with demolished homes, messy liquefaction and damaged businesses. \n4.   What role did PLAINS FM have in broadcasting information about this emergency to the community? \n\nWhen disaster strikes you naturally want to hear something in your own language. We have 68 programmes presented by community volunteers in 14 languages. It is their call as to how they inform and reassure their listeners. The PI broadcasters used talkback so the community could share their experiences, and they also used the phone to connect with radio stations in Samoa and around NZ and Australia so listeners could send messages to family and friends in other cities. Other programme makers disseminated key contact numbers, information and website addresses to listeners and utilized information from our daily updates that staff left in the live studio. One of the best websites was canterburyearthquake.org.nz which collated a lot of information from various local and national government and non-government agencies in one place, so we linked to that.  We also showed which streets were cordoned off in the CBD.\n\nWe utilised our daily staff-produced Mornings Show to interview key people from Civil Defense, the Mayor and city council staff, police, the medical officer of health, various local MPs, Salvation Army and student volunteer coordinators to name a few. \n\nQuiet Minds (our mental health show) has done a special on the mental health services that are open and what they can provide. So programme makers are targeting specific areas or topics as it applies to their respective audience.  \n5.  What lessons have the PLAINS FM community learnt from this event? \n\nIt could happen again at any time so be prepared! Make sure your landlord has your cell number so you can get updates about the safety of the building you are in. We were hearing information secondhand until I got us on to a text-tree. Have spare water stored on site, torches and a well-equipped first aid box. We had no injuries but things could have been very different if the earthquake had been bigger or had struck at a busy time of day. We also had to put notices up to boil water for 3 days after the event. Have a full list of staff and broadcaster contacts printed out at home. Retain a phone that can plug into the phone line so that you can make calls even if power is lost but phones lines are operational. We are now exploring having the ability to send out group texts from our station cellphone. More lessons will reveal themselves as time goes on. I will also be asking for feedback from our broadcasters as to what we, as staff could have done better.  \n6.   PLAINS FM recently received a Diversity Award from the Human Rights Commission in recognition of your outstanding contribution to cultural diversity and race relations. What is it about PLAINS FM that you think differentiates it from other community stations and made it a winning candidate for this prize?\n\nHe tangata! The people! Our committed broadcasters, and our creative and dedicated staff and voluntary Trust board members. Plus all those Canterbury folk who agree to share their experiences and talents as guests via interviews, music and discussion every day. Technology also has a big role to play as we share and highlight what happens here through podcast, livestream, tweets and photos. I think we’re a dynamic station with lots to say and much to contribute to the ongoing connectedness and development of our Canterbury region.",

        "text": "I was at work at Perpetual in the PGC building doing my Will at the time (I previously worked for Public Trust and my Will was with them and I thought it is time that I bought it across to Perpetual).  One of the Solicitors had walked past my desk about 10 minutes prior to the earthquake and asked me what I was doing, I advised him I was doing my Will and he said you don’t need to be doing that.  \nThe earthquake happened and it started off very gently and I thought to myself “Oh its another aftershock” and then all of a sudden it got very violent and I thought ” Oh this is not good”.  I pushed my chair back from my desk, hopped off my chair and crouched down ready to get under my desk.  I kept my left hand on my chair and effectively I was kind of squatting.  The building was pushed violently side to side and was lift in force up and down.  Next I heard the building collapsing and that’s when I swore to myself and thought “I am not going to make it”.  Everything then went black and there is a split second where I don’t know exactly what happened but I do remember hearing myself scream (kind of like an out of body experience).\nI think what happened was I lost my balance as I lost my left shoe, my glasses fell off and I must have tried to steady and re balance myself as when it stopped my right hand was on my desk and I had rubble etc trapping my hand.  I was in like a concrete cave and I had a steel beam resting on my right shoulder.  There was lots of dust and I could hear people screaming.\nBoth my cellphones were flashing and ringing non stop but they had fallen down the side of my desk and because my right hand was stuck I couldn’t reach them.\nMy initial thoughts were if our building has gone down then the rest of Christchurch has gone down so why will they come and rescue us.  I wondered if my friends were and if they were ok.\nI went through a period of denial and thought no this isn’t happened, this is just a dream and I started praying to god and my mum to get me out of there.  I also thought if our floor gives out (as the aftershocks following the big aftershock were very strong)  then I will definitely die.\nIt is so true about what they say that when you have adrealin running through your body that you can lift or move things as I was able to bend the steel beam.  I had two workmates in front of me that I couldn’t see because of a concrete wall between us.  I was able to talk to them while we waited to be rescued.  They weren’t injured and one of my workmates her partner was on the rescue team and she was able to contact him and find out what was going on outside.\nI could hear people were being rescued and it seemed pretty quick that they got rescued after it stopped and it was amazing how quickly people were on our site working at getting people out.\nI was trapped for six hours by my hand.  It really only felt like three as you could hear alot happening outside.  I kept thinking hurry up get me out of here but I knew that there wasn’t alot I could do and that I had to remain calm and wait.\nAbout half an hour prior to being rescued I was able to get my work cell phone by pushing all of my left arm right up to my shoulder down the side of my desk to get it.  I rung my Dad from inside of the building and said “Dad I am alive but my hand is stuck and I am trapped at work, our building has collapsed”.  Dad was so relieved to hear my voice as he knew in his gut that something had happened to me.  He said “Can you hear rescuers and I said yes people are being rescued at the moment and then he said your hand will be ok and I said no Dad my hand is not good”.  Initially I thought I had lost all of my hand as I couldn’t feel it and the concrete was right up to my watch on my hand.  The pain level was like a numb headache so it was bearable.\nI finally was rescued at about 6pm or just after.  My rescuer Steve is the most bravest person I know, he kept me so calm and when he saw into the side of my desk so that it tilted and my hand came free and I saw three fingers fall off and got hysterical he said calmly to me “Amanda, don’t worry about your hand, the most important thing is getting you out of here”.  I take my hat off to him as he is a hero in my eyes and I owe my life to him.\nI lost so much that day, not only my fingers but my beautiful friend and wonderful workmates.\nMy injury is so insignificant compared to what others have lost and I am so grateful to still be alive and it has made me realise how special and precious my life is",

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Gary Manch conducted shortly after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.\nMy name is Gary Manch, I am the sergeant in charge of the Lyttelton Police and I was at my home in New Brighton on the night of the earthquake.\nSo my next thought was ‘This is really bad,’ so I said to my wife, ‘Jump in the car, see if we can get out,’ because we didn’t know what the roads were like, and just after 5 o’clock we shot to the New Brighton Police Station, jumped on the radio to see what happens, then found out there was a major earthquake, lots of damage everywhere. Went back home, got some stuff – I am separated, so my kids were with my ex- wife, first thing I rang them to make sure they were OK. Then jumped into our wee 4 – wheel drive and drove straight over here to Lyttelton to the police station and started work.\nI must have been here at quarter to 6 and left at about 10.30 at night. And I was back here the next day and we did long hours again and… I knew my house was damaged and there was nothing I could do at the time – our house had minor damage really but there were lots of police officers who had serious damage but still came to work. The community was our main concern and we made sure that we do what we do.\nWe could see there was damage on the main street and the facade of the Empire and the Harbour Light and chimneys down, so we really had to make an assessment of what our priorities were, and make sure the place was safe and try and help people if they needed it and obviously make sure that people weren’t going to try and break into houses or businesses that might have broken windows or anything like that.\nBy 9 o’clock of the earthquake morning we had some more staff here and some went round to Civil Defence, Ambulance, all working together.\nI had two staff members that went to town, but the majority of my staff and myself stayed in Lyttelton, because that is our community policing area and if we hadn’t been here… they didn’t have enough staff in town to send over.\nWe were out and about, dealing with road contractors, scaffolding people, closing roads, walking around and talking with people, making sure their neighbours were safe.  \nI know this sounds corny, but it was pretty much what we do, it’s what we’re trained for. Even though it was quite major, everything went into gear and everyone worked together to keep the community safe and get things working again as quickly as possible.\nI think what stuck for me, I know it happened in other areas as well, myself and my staff were tied up at cordons on the street and working, and the reaction of the local people, we had people bringing in baking and I noticed a couple of postcards, written and drawn by children saying ‘thank you very much’, and it was really nice that the community cared and that we were appreciated. I know we are, but it was nice to be looked after.  I know at both ends of the cordon of the main street the local coffee shops and bars made sure we had plenty of food and coffee. It was really nice to see everyone come together, which I think was a highlight for me. \nI suppose the only thing is, Lyttelton is a village in many ways – we had cordons and a lot of the locals thought the cordons were for everyone else, but not for them, a bit like double parking on the main street – I can park there but no one else can, so that was quite funny in a way. You say to people, ‘Look, you can’t  go through there.’ ‘Yeah, but I am only going through.’ ‘Yeah, but it’s dangerous.’  ‘Yeah, but then I have to go the long way.’ ‘Yes, you will have to go the long way!” \n\nand I did have a couple of arguments with some people, but at the end of the day we were not closing the road to annoy people, we were closing the road for safety. People just don’t think. The longer something goes on, people become more blasé about it. \nComing to work on the Saturday morning was like something out of a movie, the roads were cracked and you’re waiting for something to explode in front of you. A lot of people left Brighton where I live, because they were afraid of a tsunami, so the traffic was going towards the hills. As soon as I knew that my family was safe it was all about getting into gear and help those people that aren’t.\nI imagined as I was driving to work – at the initial time of the earthquake no radio stations or anything was working – I imagined that we would have severe injuries and possibly loss of life and it is just amazing that no one got killed. Even the guy that had the oven fall on his head from the local supermarket, I think it fell over on top of him when he was working and he was injured. I think its amazing how lucky we were with no-one actually dying. I think one person was badly injured and taken to hospital – and look at the damage!\nI hadn’t gone to town for a week, so I had no idea about the severity of the damage in town. And it was only when I went in there at the end of the first week that I realised how lucky we were even with the damage in Lyttelton. \nWe went down the port, because we were concerned about the safety down there. At the port they were worried at some stage about the ground under the petrol tanks liquefying, which is not as bad as it sounds. They probably would have tipped over but apparently they are so well built even if they would tip over nothing would spill out of them. But all of those things going on, we were trying to prioritise, what we’d need to do and and the last thing you want is two big petrol tanks falling over because it would disrupt the supply to town and all this sort of stuff. \nPeople were worried about the tunnel and the tunnel was probably one of the safest places to be in the earth quake, it is under the volcanic rock so… Castle rock fell over too… It was funny because there were probably hundreds of things happening around us that we were dealing with.\nThere was no damage to the police building, it’s poured concrete with stone outside, we had a lot of dust from light fittings and ceilings and all that, so our house keeping wasn’t that great! We’re lucky, really lucky.\nYou feel sorry for people, like the Indian guy who did the supermarket. He worked so hard to get it going and now all of a sudden it is shut down. They reckon it will open again soon, but that would have hurt them financially, and all the other businesses that were shut for a long time.\nThere were at least three staff whose homes were totally wrecked and they fronted up for work that day, it’s admirable really. And Brendan here was one of them. He got here about 9 o’clock and said ‘House is damaged, but my wife is safe.’ and I think that is everyone’s opinion, as long as their pets and wives and children are safe   \nI think it affected everyone in some way, whether you’re a police officer or residents or fire men. I think the biggest things for our guys here was that they had to deal with their own things at home, a lot have young children who were frightened as well as deal with your public duties.\nThe damage out there is pretty much under control now. Over the last 4 or 5 weeks the main street got opened again, a couple of churches are still shut because of the damage to the spires and towers, but it’s pretty much business as usual for us.\nLast week was probably the quietest week we had. And I can tell things are going back to normal because the little rat bags in the port starting to do naughty little things again. The minor crime disappeared for a while, because there was a bigger presence of army and police on the streets, and also those families and kids had to deal with their own problems and not actually going out and doing graffiti or that sort of stuff. But there was an upturn in domestic instances with people getting stressed at home and arguing with their husbands and wife and children, so a double-edged sword really. \nThe processes we have in place are pretty sound. I think especially the local volunteer fireservice did a fantastic job with chimneys. Fulton Hogan, they have a guy here, they gave us trucks and barriers, we got stuff when we needed it, so I think it all went pretty well. Of course the first couple of hours there was chaos, there would be chaos, but after the first couple of hours things were in place and worked pretty well.  But it depends on the level of it. If this had been an 8 or a 9, there may have been serious loss of life, there may have been more damage to buildings and of course that would create more pressure on everyone .\nIt brought it home to me that the community pulled together really well, and that was fantastic, and generally everyone was working towards the same goal of helping each other and that was fantastic.\nI probably worked 80 or 90 hours that week, I did 11 days without a break. I was lucky coz my boss sent me home on Thursday afternoon in the second week, But every police man and fire man was doing the same, that wasn’t a special thing, the guys here would have done even longer hours if I hadn’t sent them home. When I got stood down I was ready for it because I think you get tired.\nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton.

        "text": "“It’s not life or death!” I remember saying to my friend, as at the time, deciding where to go for lunch seemed like a tiny decision in our lives, but in the end, it turns out it WAS a life or death situation. School finished at 12:00 because of a teachers union meeting in town (which my mother was attending because she teaches here at CGHS) So I had to find my own way home that day. The bus into the bus exchange was running late, so we decided to walk down to the Burger King on the corner of Bealey Ave and Papanui Road.  After a long walk we finally arrived and my friends and I ordered our lunches.\nI still remember carrying my tray over to the table and picking up a french fry, when suddenly, it hit. My friends and I looked up at each other, we all had the same shocked expression on our face as we dived under the table.  The ground was shaking crazily, and having three girls huddled under a  tiny plastic table did not seem like a safe place to be. “EVERYBODY OUT!” I heard a man yell over the screams and cracking ice type sounds, which I later found out to be bricks and glass breaking. We made our way out to the car park, which was filled with customers from the surrounding shops, crying and trying to contact people. There was even a woman with foils in her hair and a hair dressing cape on! Luckily, no one had died in our area, but I could see crashed buildings, rubble and dust as far as the eye could see. I immediately thought about my mum in the town hall, along with all the other teachers at our school, were they okay? What about all the girls who had taken the bus to the bus exchange, were they okay? \nChristchurch definitely came together as a community, as complete strangers were surrounding us, making sure we were okay and asking if we had made contact with our parents yet. I hadn’t heard from my mum yet, but all I could do was pray she was alright. My friend Sam made contact with her mum and we headed back to her house which was down the road. We had to leap to stay on dry ground, as liquefaction was overflowing the street. When we finally made it to Sam’s house, it reeked of alcohol, as every bottle from every cupboard  was smashed on the kitchen floor. After spending the next hour or so sweeping up glass and occasionally diving under the table, I finally got a call from my parents and managed to get home safely.  My house and family were all fine, as we live quite a distance away from town, but I was definitely shaken although very thankful for my life.",

You had to fight to stay upright. I saw three women clutching part of a wall and went to join them, with difficulty. The first shock had stopped and I went to the counter to see if I could be of any assistance as there were older ladies in trouble and stressed out. I grabbed hold of one lady and  escorted her from the building to stand outside the Doctor’s rooms opposite. She was hysterical and wouldn’t let go of me. She saw a lady who lived at the same complex as her so I took her over to her. I was concerned for my dog that I had left at home in her kennel and wanted to get back home.

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Brendan Evans conducted five weeks after the 4 September 2010 earthquake.\nMy name is Marc Buckley and I am the Chief Fire Officer here in Lyttelton. I was at home as the quake hit, and as part of our procedures we had for years, any event, like the earthquake, our plan has always been, was get all your family together and actually bring our family to the fire station. So basically within 5 or 10 minutes after the earthquake had hit I moved my family down here and about 7 or 8 other families arrived not long afterwards. So the hall was full of people, kids in different states of shock I suppose, but it was good, they were all together, they were all able to talk with each other, and it was good from our family’s point of view, because it meant that the guys could come away and go about what we needed to do, and make sure Lyttelton was OK and the residents that needed assistance we could help, so it meant the families were here, they were safe, everything was good, they were being looked after.\nBut after that point our next biggest problem was actually to get our fire trucks outside, because the doors are electric and they’ve got a manual override, but as all of those things, Murphy’s law took over, and first the electric doors and then the manual override broke! So we couldn’t get the front doors open! So we had to open the rear door which is a manual door, and then we had to get both fire trucks out the back door, so that took us a period of time. \nBy this stage everyone had started to come here, and ask questions and ask what can be done, and really until it became light, we didn’t know what the state of play was here in Lyttelton. We were obviously getting feedback from our communications system in town, and they were telling us that some of the buildings in the central part of Christchurch had come down altogether, and we thought ‘Oh geez, we could have houses that are collapsed,” and so on because at that stage we had no power, telephones were a bit marginal, cell phones were still working, which was really good that we had the cell phone network still working.\nUntil it was light there really wasn’t much use doing much, cause no one was coming here and saying “Look, can you come and help us straight away.” We were getting nothing like that. We weren’t being turned out from town, so we thought, oh well, that’s all right, so we dug in a bit here, we got the generators going, we made sure the ambulance guys were happy, we had to find some fuel for the ambulances, because one of the ambulances was low on fuel… So we ended up sending them to the Port Company and they filled them up with diesel down there.\nThe tunnel was closed then, and we closed Evans Pass, because one of our guys couldn’t get through the tunnel, he lives in Heathcote. So he bundled his family up in the car, came over Evans Pass and he said it was so bad… you don’t want to know. He said there were rocks all over the road, rocks all coming down. So at that point in time we talked to the Sumner fire brigade, and they closed it at the top and we closed it at the bottom. So, essentially, without saying that we were cut off, other than the likes of Gebbies Pass and the Sign of the Kiwi, we were cut off to certain degree. \nThat was fine, because we had been planning for that, and so that was good and we had everyone here and once daylight came we started I suppose, for want of a better word, just floating around the streets, we sent the 2 trucks out and the van. One truck started at East, one started at West, and the van we sent around to Rapaki and Corsair Bay, just to do a circuit, to make sure no one was in dire straits of any degree. Everything was fine and then I suppose it took a good hour or so, even an hour and a half after daylight before people looked at their houses and realised there were a few issues, so that’s when we started our turnouts and we were doing chimneys, retaining walls, hot water cylinders, foundations of houses. So all of a sudden, the fire brigade became… not the experts, but the go-to people, to come and see if the cracks in my foundation or the cracks in my walls were all right or not. And we gave the best advice. \nLuckily in the Brigade we’ve got builders, quite a few people that are involved with structural work, civil engineering, so we’ve got quite a good make up in the brigade as far as a cross section of people. That’s the beauty of being a volunteer brigade. So we started doing all those sorts of things. We had, oh we had chimneys by the dozens and dozens and dozens. We did about 185 chimneys, we either made secure or we took down, so most of them had to be taken down, well probably a 50-50 split to be perfectly honest. They posed a risk, with another little aftershock or with a bit of high wind. The chimneys we took down were the ones that would fall over and go through someone’s roof or fall onto a path way where there could be people walking, so we had all these sorts of things. \nJust to give you some sort of idea, up until the day of the earthquake for the year we’ve done 57 calls. From the Saturday through to Thursday night, just in that period alone, we’d done a 130 calls. So the boys were flat out, and I mean it was great because they just kept coming in and guys did turn over. We had someone who did the Sunday, but couldn’t make it on Monday because they had to go to work, but then others came on Monday so the guys were swapping and changing the whole time. So everyone participated and helped out which was great. \nSo we didn’t start the turnout till 7.30, 8 in the morning and then the guys would go right through to 6 o’clock at night, we drew the line at 6 o’clock. And the we said, right, we only want to be turned out for emergencies because the guys need their rest.  So we did this for about 4 days straight. But the good thing was, we had lunch and cups of tea in the hall for the guys as time went on and we had people walk in with trays of cakes and biscuits and scones and that.  The guys went out and they came back three or four hours later, they were pretty buggered and said ‘Oh, I really don’t want to go out again.’ But someone would bring some food in and that would fire them up again and they’d say ‘Oh, come on, let’s get back on the road, another 10  jobs.’ So that was great to see, and it really did help, And people would come in and say ‘Oh, sorry, that’s the best we can do, only some biscuits’, but we’d say ‘No, that’s cool, no worries.’ That gave the guys such a morale boost, because it made it easier for them to get back out on the road again.\nWe had a call on Sunday night and it was to a water cylinder that had ruptured in the ceiling of an elderly couple’s house and we walked in and the lady was just sitting there sobbing, because  there had just been the earthquake and now there was water covering the middle of her lounge – she’d had enough. So we isolated it and made it safe and then the guys rang the plumber for her, made her a cup of tea and made sure she was alright because her husband was much the same, in a bit of disrepair I suppose. We made sure they had water outside so they could go and fill the jug up, so the guys settled them down. So you come away and you know you’ve done the best you can and as much as you can but you feel a bit helpless, because obviously things like that are out of your control.\nIt took about a week, a week and a half for the calls to taper off, we still kept getting calls for unstable chimneys for 2 weeks after, because of the aftershocks. Even now we are getting calls, but we are tending to step back now and let the contractors that are geared up to do them, because in the first instance we are to help anyone with anything, but as time goes on you have to realistically say, well, no, there is actually someone that can come and do it for you. Unless it is an immediate emergency there is someone that can come and do it for you. And that’s good too.\nOther than that I think it has been a good team building. I mean you don’t like to say… there is some good that can come out of times like that and the thing is that the guys have got a heap of experience, they did really well working together and it brought together the whole brigade in a sort of fashion.\nWe have been looked after by the Fire Service staff, they made sure that everything is all right and they have offered counselling for any of the families or the people that are finding things a bit stressful. So we had a really good backup from town.\nIn the first week I suppose I worked… ahhh. 80, 90 hours. My day job had to go on hold, at the end of the day I kept in touch on the phone, but the fire brigade took over my life for the week. I am grateful that the company I work for was fully supporting that. It was just one of those things where you do what you have to, and luckily my employer is understanding, because I wouldn’t be able to do it otherwise.\nIt’s funny because I have to honestly say when the earthquake was happening I was obviously very aware and concerned because you think ‘When is it going to stop?’ but once it had finished I think what took over were the years of instilled training and coming to the realisation that if something like this happened this is what we’re going to do. So, to be perfectly honest, the first 2 days I really didn’t have time to be concerned. It was more making sure our guys were OK, were on the road where they needed to be, make sure we were getting all the calls done, making sure we had food brought in for the guys for lunches, making sure their families were OK. It wasn’t really till the Tuesday, Wednesday that I had time to think about what had really happened and probably how lucky we were more than anything. So many places in the world had earthquakes of similar sizes and there’s been hundreds of people killed, so not to have one person killed is… it is just luck, that’s all it is.\nAs time has gone on you sort of come to terms with… what we had put in place worked, and I can’t speak highly enough of the guys in the brigade, for the time they put in and the effort, just phenomenal really. There is 23 of us and the majority live in Lyttelton, we have a couple of guys that live in Heathcote, so we are pretty much Lyttelton based, and everyone’s got a fulltime job they’ve got to go to – but a group of people would turn up every day, because their work was affected or had been shut down for the week, and then we had a few that floated in and floated out as time permitted.\nThe firestation stood up relatively well to it, there are a few fissures and cosmetic things like in most houses, but structurally it seems to have done very well which is quite funny they are actually going through New Zealand at the moment, doing engineering reports on all the fire stations for this particular thing, but ours hasn’t been done yet but it’s all OK, we’ve got our green sticker on, so we can feel confident it’s a safe building. \nOver the years, if I can speak about the Civil Defence side of things, we never really had too much contact because I suppose its one of those things you think “Oh, yes, we must do that.’.  We could have done better on the Civil Defense side of things here in Lyttelton, which I think will happen next time, because we’ve made the comments and asked the people, but I know in the future I’ll definitely keep a closer eye on how they are, on what they are doing, as far as manning wise and people and so on.\nThere are a few things that would be nice – we haven’t got a decent generator here on station and I think even for that one time in ten years that you need it it would be really good so we might look into putting a decent size generator here on station. But everything else we ticked off and was good. We had the back up fuel supply, we knew where to get water from. So all these things that my predecessors, chiefs and senior chiefs, have done over the years –  all of us have done a little bit of planning here and there, and it all has come together. So you pass it on from one chief to the next, and teach those relevant things so that the guys coming up next know where it is, how it works, what will happen.\nThere were  funny bits: as a rule we the fire brigade don’t do work with harnesses, so from my point of view it was funny to see how the brigade changed their operations to suit what we had to do and they did it so easily. The guys were so good, we ended up with 4 or 5 harnesses. So when you are up on a roof you tie people on a harness and as a rule fire services don’t have those because it’s not what we need or what we have as part of our training, but we had 4 or 5 guys walking around in harnesses, ready to go out, so that was completely different. \nAnother thing on top of the fire truck we carried sheets of ply, old mattresses and some other bits and pieces which we found were very good for using on roofs for pushing chimneys over and to protect roofs. So all of a sudden the trucks were going around carrying gear on top so you’d be going ‘Why the heck would they be carrying this sort of stuff around?’  Mattresses were ideal for chimneys – we went to one and one of  the guys said “Look, what we need is some foam or mattresses and then we tie the plywood around the chimneys and then we push the whole chimney over and…’ The guys were always thinking ‘this could be easier’. They were thinking of people’s property, the guy’s were thinking outside the square, so that was great. \nAnd I have to say without the help of Jules and the timebank… we were able to push some jobs there, and we knew they were low-risk, they were quite straight-forward, they were helping us out.\nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton.

I was 4 months pregnant and my 3 year old was on his day off from preschool. Out of the blue the noise and violent movement hit, all the books from my study started to fall on me and I started to run to my 3 year to get him. The floor rolled the walls swayed plaster started to fall, my thoughts were I’m going to die, but I have to get to my son.\nWhen I got to my son his head was out the door of the room and his body stuck with the heavy door moving back and forth the plaster roof had crumbled over him, the TV had thrown it self to the floor, games splattered everywhere.\nI grabbed him in my arms and we stood together in the front doorway watching the 2 heavy lion statues being thrown from the door way, the blow up pool swirling and moving like jelly…very scary.\nMy panic then moved to how  is my husband in the middle of the city, my son at the local school my parents, I need to get my cell phone which is back in the study, I could not leave my son on his own, so together we went back in grabbed it and ran out to the open part of our garden..no where felt safe, near trees near the house everything moving constantly.\nAll the lines where busy the network had gone crazy, so I called family in Auckland and asked them to get onto the computer and find out any information for me, I found out the shake was centred close to us and surprised that it was a 6 and made so much damage.\nMy husband was safe and managed to get out  of a building alive he walked home covered in white dust he told me he saw people dying, panic and buildings falling people in shock it was chaos.\nMy son was safe at school but shaken and shocked by the time we got to him. My mother and father were safe, but my mother was in shock and would not come out from  under the table.\nWe spent our first night all of us in 1 small tent in the garden using the BBQ trying to work out what to do next, with shakes rumbling and jolting us for weeks and months to follow.\nTwo  years on we have just moved out of the garage and into a rental our house will be fully repaired sarting end July 2013 finished middle of 2014.

        "text": "Copy of an email sent to friends on 5th September 2010…..\nThanks for your emails and concerns.  To tell you the truth it is probably one of the scariest experiences I have been through.  Normally with earthquakes you get a bit of shaking, creaking etc and then it goes and you think ‘was that an earthquake or a truck?’  Well not this one.  It woke us up but then it went on and on and got worse.  By this time you are fully awake and think it’s time to head to a doorway, but it’s dark and you stumble around trying to find the doorway.  John got up so fast he just about passed out.  We called to Chris and he was alright so we piled into his room grabbing a flashlight and shower radio as we had no power.  Aftershocks came almost immediately which were also frightening.  There have been over 50 since and while they are subsiding it is still a constant reminder that the earth is settling and can be unnerving.  Chris wasn’t too fazed; the cat however was traumatised and went under his bed for the next three hours.\nFortunately for us the damage was minimal.  We lost a vase which was a wedding gift and have a crack on the corner of the house and one in the ceiling.  Others haven’t been so lucky although they say we have dodged the bullet as there were no deaths or major injuries.  If it had occurred during the day…\nPoor Leigh and Rob (Jo’s niece) had a worse time at Pines Beach.  We went out there today and their house moved about half a metre, the deck at the front is now a ramp, silt covers the whole back yard and basically it is unlivable.  They are currently staying with Rob’s parents at Rangiora.  The kids are a bit anxious and haven’t slept well or want to go back.  Hopefully by the end of the week there will be some assessment done.  (NB  an update on their situation as at 2016 – they never did live there again.  They had full replacement insurance on their simple two bedroom house and their insurer Tower insurance were leaning to a rebuild until the area was red zoned.  It then changed to a ‘repair’ and they were offered $9000!  They are still paying premiums on a house they no longer live in which is standing derelict and are getting legal help.  They have moved three times and now rent not own a property.)\nEmail sent 7th September….\nWe are coping well although I have to say that the aftershocks can be unsettling especially as the ones last night were about 5.3 and very jolting.  I was out of bed at one of them and half way to the door frame.  I used to find previous earthquakes experienced were a bit of a novelty but that has changed.\nMost of you will know that it was the same level on the Richter scale as the one in Haiti.  What a difference in the outcome though with no casualties!  That is such a blessing.  We still have to boil water and schools are off all week.\nHere are some things I found helpful and will mention in case it may help you.  We all know about the emergency kit etc and that is important but in the immediate time after the quake these are the things we found most helpful.  First a handy torch to stop you groping round in the dark, a cell phone that is charged for phoning/txting, a phone that can plug in as with no power we could not use our hand held but had an old cord phone we use in the garage, and finally a portable radio.  We have a shower radio and this was a lifeline to hear what was going and we were glued to it for several hours.  We have an emergency kit in the basement which probably isn’t the ideal place but having immediate access to a radio and phone was a great relief.  This was all because it was dark and our power was out but if anything is really bad then the power will usually be lost.\nSomeone said ‘your nerves must be shot’\nPretty much.  John doesn’t want to sleep in our room tonight, we may sleep in the hall.  We have had offers from friends or even using our caravan.  I think it is because there has been talk that there may still be a mag 6 one to come and I don’t fancy that.  So far all the bad ones have been when we have been home so I am seeing home as not a safe place.\nEmail 9th September…\nCommunity spirit has been strong, we had a nasty aftershock yesterday which was only 5.1 but only 6km deep and near the peninsula.  It was short (thank goodness) and sharp and made our microwave fly out of its slot onto the kitchen floor just missing John who had ducked into the door frame.  The turntable smashed and I don’t fancy using it again anyway.  At least the aftershocks are fewer although in the paper this morning they said there have been 355 seismic shocks since Saturday and 2 hours 49 minutes total of tremors!\nA word about aftershocks- \n\nIt’s the aftershocks that have spooked everyone.  They are a constant reminder that it’s not over yet and damage could still occur – as did with the 5.1 on the Wednesday which was worse over this side of town.  There was also talk that it is common for an aftershock to be one point lower than the main quake so we have all been nervous awaiting that.  for the first few days you would be up out of your seat/bed heading smartly for the doorway.  Now you generally stay put and can assess (as we are all now experts) whether it is in the 3 range or 4 range.  Tonight the 12th there was a 4.5 at 5.30pm which lasted a few seconds.  Cat didn’t leave her chair for once but didn’t look too impressed.  These may last for weeks – oh joy.  Our house looks like we are packing to move.  All the pictures are off the walls, everything off the hutch dresser and glassware from the corner cabinet and fancy glasses cabinet.\nNote – everything was back in place by the February quake and all was broken – including another microwave that shot out of the slot in the wall.",

Our 5 year old daughter was already in bed with us, so we all scrambled under the door way. It seemed to last such a long time. I remember it being very cold as we all went outside to find fellow neighbours outside looking at each other with bewilderment. The next few hours were full of cars heading out of town, for fear of tsunami, we live by the beach so this was to be expected. We stayed put after hearing on the radio that chance of tsunami was slim. For a long time after this I stayed very close to my daughter, not wanting to let her out of my sight, terrified that this would happen again.\nFeburary 8th and we had a baby boy, aftershocks had died down and I certainly did not hold the same fear I did after September, life was getting back to normal and we had a wee baby which helped us all focus on something else. Feburary the 22nd started out as normal, I walked my daughter to school and settled at home with baby. Just before lunch a good friend of mine popped in for a cupa and to meet wee Izak. I sat on the couch happily feeding the baby while Kylee sat at the table and we chatted away. It was not to be a long chat, for soon after that I remember Kylee beside me on the couch with her arms over myself and Izak to protect us. Everything in the house flew in all directions, the oven popped off the wall, glass was smashing, bricks were popping off the outside of the house directly outside from where we were sitting. I remember screaming ‘don’t squash me, the baby’. Soon after that I was in hysterics yelling for my daughter at school. \nI was absolutely terrified. Kylee helped to try keep me calm, she drove me to the school then headed off to rescue her own children from school. As I ran to the school field where the children were, all I could hear was screaming, hundreds of children screaming, terrified. I scanned all around searching for my daughter, “Jayme, Jayme” I called to the teachers, finally I found her huddled with her friends. Not a tear in her eye, such a brave wee girl. I tried to comfort other children until their parents arrived, luckily Izak slept through the whole affair! \nAcross the field I see my sister running towards us, she was very upset. She had been to our house to look for us and then came straight to the school. She had run for quite some distance to get to us. Since this traumatic day life has definately changed in many ways. It is in the back of my head every day, I cannot travel over the other side of town while my daughter is at school. The thought of not being able to get to her terrifies me. I have kept my son close to me throughout his short 7 months of life. I still wonder if we are doing the right thing staying in Chrischurch, wonder if we are safe and when the next big one will hit. The process of recovery will be a long one, there is alot of healing to be done. I am so grateful that my loved ones were all ok, my heart goes out to those that were not so fortunate. The earthquake has brought many people closer together which can be noted as one good thing, other then that I must say it was certainly the most scary day of my life!\nThanks Kylee for being there for me, and thankyou to my sister Keita who has been beside me throughout the whole ordeal.xx",

Strangers talking to strangers; so-called drunken students spending days and days shovelling shit; huge displays of courage, strength and compassion and the outpouring of money, time, unitedness and kindness of a nation.\n\nThe most common text message for the past year has been “R U OK????” \n\n- R U … alive?\n\n-R U … needing help?\n\n-R U… having an ok day?\n\n-R U … needing a cuddle?\nThey say that what doesn’t kill us only makes us stronger.\n\nFor most of us it hasn’t killed us but it has made us face our fears, face depression, face anxiety, face uncertainty, face an unwanted rollercoaster ride that never stops, face losing a loved one, face losing a job, face not wanting to go to work, face losing a home, face losing a work colleague, face feeling emotional, face upset children, face trauma, face moving and face losing our beloved city.\nThey say that Cantabrians are tough, stoic and resiliant.\nI just think that whether we recognise it or not; our hearts are so entrenched in this very special city that we CAN’T let Mother Nature beat us for if we do then the very soul of Christchurch is  broken and THAT is unthinkable",

        "text": "It’s taken me four years to get around to telling my earthquake story. One reason for that might be a craving for normality. I’m not a person who readily welcomes big changes in my life, and sometimes when change is forced upon us, the easiest way to deal with it is to keep focused on that which is familiar and stable, rather than the new and unexpected.\n\nAnother reason might be that it has taken me this long to realise that actually, the earthquakes have had a pretty big impact on my life, but if anything, it’s been a positive one and perhaps I feel that this somehow makes it less significant.\nIt doesn’t seem right to feel grateful for something that had such tragic implications for so many. I was really fortunate that no one I knew directly, nor my house, was badly affected (it definitely helped being a student and living on the west side of town). Instead, the earthquakes have opened doors and provided new opportunities. From where I’m standing the walls that crumbled in Christchurch weren’t only those made of bricks, but the metaphorical sort as well – the sort that kept us contained within our rigid, inwardly-focused ways of life. The sort that reinforced the status quo and discouraged us from being spontaneous and experimental, daring and playful. \nFor a long time I dismissed my experiences as irrelevant because they didn’t fit the more conventional picture of grief and devastation, whereas now I can look at things from a different angle and see that even worse would be failing to appreciate and make the most of the opportunities that arose. Because I haven’t had to deal with the stress of insurance claims, or the grief of losing my home or someone close to me, I’ve had the chance to get out and explore this tentative new city emerging from the rubble. It opened up a space in which I felt I could contribute something, and the fact that I can seems like enough of a reason to do so.\nThere are many things I miss about pre-quake Christchurch. I miss lazy Sunday afternoons at the Arts Centre, where Daegan and I used to get lunch from one of the vendors (usually satay chicken kebabs on rice), then wander around the galleries and sit in the sunny quadrant. I miss late nights at SOL square, particularly the underground Culture Club with its graffiti-covered concrete walls, 80s beats and alternative crowd. I miss the free electric buses in the CBD, and the bustle of the central exchange.\nMore and more, as they come down at an ever-increasing rate, I miss the heritage buildings, and wish I had looked up more and really noticed the architectural intricacies from bygone eras. It’s just like Joni Mitchell sang: “Don’t it always seem to go that you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone / They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot”.\nMuch of our central city has been converted into car parks, and it’s only now as I sit at my computer at work, archiving photographs of the buildings that used to exist in these spaces, that I see them in their full beauty. \nBut it was the emergence of these concrete wastelands that sparked artists and creative types into action. No one talks about the outcomes of the Christchurch earthquakes without mentioning Gap Filler, and I’m very aware that I’m adding yet another cliched anecdote to the dialogue surrounding Christchurch, which comes packaged with buzzwords such as ‘community’, ‘resilience’ and ‘temporary’.\nAs a ‘creative type’, however, I have really appreciated and been inspired by the expansion and disruption of the Christchurch art scene. From where I stand, Gap Filler were the initial ‘disruptors’, with their DIY, try-it-out attitude, and a desire to encourage us to consider what we really value when rebuilding the city (hint: it’s probably not the car parks). Soon there were creative happenings on vacant sites everywhere, and other groups and organisations forming, such as FESTA and Greening The Rubble. It felt like Christchurch had woken up, and was asserting itself to the rest of the world as a city of culture and character.\nThis feeling was reinforced after visiting New York in the middle of last year. Everyone knows New York is an artist’s dream, but I couldn’t help feeling that a lot of the things that make it so great are things that we now have here in post-quake Christchurch: the street art, the pop-up shops, the community gardens and collaborative work spaces. The high chances of running into someone doing something a bit strange and different, because they can. The walls are down – there is more room to move.\nIf it weren’t for this change in atmosphere, I wouldn’t have stumbled across a rather obscure field of art known as ‘social practice’, which I delved into during my final year of Fine Arts. My ‘art’ came to exist as public projects, events and interventions. I joined an artist collective called The Social, and was excited to find there were others in Christchurch thinking along similar lines, who may have also been feeling a sudden sense of freedom and opportunity to explore these ‘new age’ styles of creative practice. Of course it’s completely possible, given this sort of art has existed in other places around the world – particularly Europe and the US – for quite some time, that it was making its way over here anyway, but something tells me the reception in Christchurch would have been quite different had it not been for the earthquakes. We’re a bit more open-minded now, more spontaneous, more willing to engage with strangers. More… connected?\nAlthough I find it hard to adjust to change, I know it’s inevitable. By letting our experiences and environments shape us, we grow as people. I think it’s important that we allow ourselves to be changed, and to realise that if we want to, we can also create change, all around us. It’s up to us to shape our cities so that they can continue to shape us.\nIt was this desire to see the potential of our future city realised that prompted myself and several others to form the Christchurch branch of Generation Zero in mid 2013. Generation Zero is a nationwide group of young people who want to see our country on the path to a low-carbon future. Although the earthquakes were probably to blame for a Christchurch group not kicking off a couple of years earlier alongside the other main centres, the rebuild gives us a unique opportunity to create a sustainable, future-focused city that’s designed for people.\nI probably wouldn’t be writing this reflection at all were it not for my current position with CEISMIC – the Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive. My job is probably the most obvious thing I have gained as a result of the earthquakes, and a project which I feel privileged to be part of. At first I felt pretty apathetic towards the material we were working with – I didn’t feel connected to the earthquakes in the same way that the people who’s stories and content we were collecting clearly were. But I think as time has passed and we’ve started working with more material centered on the recovery and re-build, I’ve begun to see that while my part of the story doesn’t take place in the initial chaos and devastation, this doesn’t make it any less valid, and that goes for anyone in Christchurch. In fact that could probably be extended to the rest of New Zealand – we’re a small country and the fallout from a disaster of this scale isn’t confined to the city it strikes.\nSo here’s to our city, Otautahi, four years on. It’s clear when standing amidst the wastelands, the piles of gravel, the road cones, cranes and construction sites, that we still have a long way to go, but at the moment I’m enjoying the journey, and I’d like to think that we’re on our way to creating a city that’s better than it was before.",

        "text": "At the supermarket in Timaru, I’m wondering if I stand out like a sore thumb in borrowed men’s cargo pants and pink girlie op shop t-shirt. My new earthquake Refugee image. I’m still in a daze nearly two weeks later. I overhear two women. “But how do you get rid of them when you’ve had enough?” says one. “They might never want to leave!” the other agrees.\nThis is the new me. A Quake evacuee.  A Refugee.  My son Oscar, 7, is a Quake Kid.\nFew of us foresaw the disaster, or the exodus of 70,000 that would follow. Timaru and other parts of New Zealand have welcomed us. The reception I get when I phone Barton Rural School to temporarily enroll Oscar is kind.\nI am one of the lucky ones. At home when the earthquake struck, just another aftershock, but morphing into a terrifying shudder with two violent sideways shunts that knocked me to my knees. I was powerless except to hold on to the doorway and ride it out. I prayed out loud. \nI thought of all the people in town. I knew this time there would be death. \nStill, as I ran outside on shaking legs, I couldn’t imagine the scale of it. My neighbour, a young mother was sitting on the ground, crying out in terror. I tried to comfort her. “Don’t worry it’s over now, it won’t happen again.”\nEven as I said it, I knew the mantra I’d repeated to myself and my son after September 4 no longer worked.\n———\nDays 2-5:  I’ve moved back into our empty but fully furnished Timaru house with Oscar and his brother, Finnegan, 15, who goes to Roncalli. My Christchurch friend Justine and her crew – partner, two kids, and Pluto the dog – have moved in for a few days, en route to Queenstown. Justine talks about leaving Christchurch for good. Leaving behind the death, destruction and dust for life on more solid ground. I’m having the same thoughts. It’s hard to have clarity. The adrenalin is still pumping, the shock making it hard to grasp, to absorb the numbers –  the missing, the dead. It’s a disaster happening somewhere else, but it’s not  – it’s Christchurch. It hurts to think any further ahead than half a day.\n———\nMy street, near Beckenham School, is much closer to the epicenter this time. \nMy house is structurally OK, although a lot more stuff is broken than on September 4. But we are safe and one neighbour, Bernie, is a survivalist.  He has everything for a civil emergency. Every day he wears desert coloured vintage army gear and drives his vintage army jeep. He rallies the neighbourhood troops over for a cup of tea.\nI hurry to school to find Oscar. On the way my car wheels start to buckle. I see the power lines waving overhead. The first big aftershock.\nAt school, the children are on the big field where large patches of liquefaction bubble to the surface. Oscar is fine, just overly excited. He tells me he was going up the steps into his classroom when the quake happened. He held on tight to the steps.\nPupils huddle with teachers on the grass. A little girl is crying, shivering. I wrap my arms around her to keep her warm. Her parents have not arrived yet and numbers are dwindling. I find warm clothes in my car. We find out her mother was in hospital with her sister when the quake struck. Her father has gone in to find them.\nMothers come and go, some faces fearful. It’s dawning that things have gone terribly wrong. Word begins to filter through. The Cathedral is down. Two buses are crushed. Fatalities.\n———\nDay 7: I turn the television on and sit alone in my two minutes silence. Tears flow but my mind is still numb.\nDay 9: Brother in law Dan takes me back to Christchurch to clean up my house. The fridge is a forest of green mould. The water and power are back on. We clear up the broken glass and liquefaction, pack clothes and put the bikes, which I don’t want stolen, on his truck. Half the neighbours I met on the night have left town.\n———\nNinety minutes after the earthquake, back at my street, Bernie has set up a gigantic kettle on a gas stove and a tepid cup of Earl Grey comes my way. It tastes great. A teepee style dune coloured tent has been erected in Bernie’s front yard with camping chairs set around a transistor radio. \nThe ground bucks, often. About ten people from the neighbourhood are gathered, including a baby, a toddler, some older children and three dogs.  On the radio, the gravity of the earthquake is emerging. The CTV building is down. The PGG building is down. I know of someone in the CTV building. And a job I applied for before Christmas was to have been based there. I hold my head in my hands, rubbing my eyes, trying to grasp the enormity. The adrenalin is pumping, and won’t subside for days. It’s a surreal state suspended between unreality and dawning realization. Knowing how life can take one turn or another heightens my state of shock.\nHelicopters fly overhead, ambulance, fire and police sirens wail, regular aftershocks shake the power poles. I text my Timaru sisters asking for someone to come and get Oscar and me. I have no petrol and don’t know where I’d get any. \nWhile inside checking the damage, a big aftershock shakes my house like 40 devils – chasing me outside. On September 4 I’d felt safe in my house. This time, not.\nWe set up a BBQ and pool the food from our defrosting freezers. Bernie’s response to the emergency – having failed to find a local civil defence unit to join – is humour. He defrosts the chicken in hot water, then jokes how it was bath water. Not coq au vin but coq au bath he quips. This goes down like a lead balloon among the women. \nBy now people are filtering back from town, corporate suited men walk by in bare feet. It’s taking three hours to drive what would normally take 20 minutes. Bernie’s wife arrives safely home from town in a taxi at 5pm. Strangers passing in the street swap news.\nWe discuss where we’ll spend the night.  In tents?  Our empty house in Timaru has water, electricity, even the phone.  If need be Oscar and I will sleep in the car on the road. The overhead power lines look threatening but as Bernie said, they haven’t fallen yet.\n———\nDay 13: Justine is back in Christchurch, her children at schools in Queenstown and Nelson. Keeping daily contact, we assess the viability of staying in Christchurch. She’s studying at the Jazz school which is inside the red zone, and unlikely to reopen there. Another friend has already moved to Dunedin.\nEn masse, peoples’ dreams have been dismantled. A pall of death and destruction hangs over the future. The prospect is of picking up the pieces and hobbling on in a city landscape riddled with holes.\nThose for whom Christchurch is their home town, with extended family and deep roots, will probably stay. Others, with new fragile roots, or facing too big a hurdle, might cut their losses and leave. Some have fled in fear, but most will weigh up the options. For some it will be a business decision, about jobs. Anecdotally, some recent English immigrants are going home.\nFor me, with one son already at school in Timaru, it’s a dilemma. It helps to know that if I leave Christchurch, a family who needs a house to rent will find one.  \n———\nAt the campsite, after tea, there are spots of rain. I pack a bag outside dashing in to grab random clothes, valuables. I give my solar torch and analogue phone to neighbours.\nFudge the cat, is terrified, hiding under the house, but comes out whenever I call.\nMy brothers in law get on the road to pick us up. They will bring water and an emergency stash of cigarettes for neighbours. Not the time to give up smoking.\n———\nDay 14: Christchurch has been my home on and off since the 1980s.  My Madras Street student flat was round the corner from Piko Wholefoods, a charming two storey, 1900s red brick building. I read that Piko staff found out the building was being demolished as the demo crew moved in. Like many I worry there will be rash decisions and no heritage buildings left. Much of the death toll came from modern buildings.  I turn off the lights this night and think of Piko. It’s one of many corners of Christchurch, along with the monumental ones like the Catholic Basilica, which I love. Another wave of grief hits me. \nWhat’s hardest to reconcile about living in Christchurch is not more aftershocks, but the heartache I will feel each time I find another landmark vanished.\n———\nSeven hours after the earthquake, the rain is pouring down. Oscar’s uncles, Dale and Dan, find us in the wet and dark. They’ve stopped for water in Ashburton but the town is out. Water is now more precious than gold.\nWe pack Fudge into my car, which Dan drives, and join the steady flow of traffic heading south in the rain. Fleets of emergency vehicles from towns further south pass us heading for Christchurch.  I keep repeating, “Got the Kid, Got the Cat. My Refugee travel list.  Kid, Tick. Cat, Tick.” \n———\nDay 15:  My dilemma intensifies with Beckenham School ready to reopen. Sharing the problem with friends and family there are two lines of thought.  One, it’s a no-brainer to stay in Timaru. The other, maybe you would regret it. One says, there’s no hurry. I agree. I decide to stay on until March 30.\nOscar has begun expressing fear. He is having bad dreams. So am I – every night. I dream often of aftershocks. Normally a sound sleeper, every night I wake up and can’t get back to sleep.\nAfter September 4 I would suddenly imagine the ground was moving and feel off balance. The ground in Timaru feels solid. In Christchurch, a new sense of community will soften the blow. New bars, cafes and restaurants will open. There will be an insider’s camaraderie. \nI work on the top floor of a major, mostly modern two storey building. It rattled frighteningly in a major aftershock post September 4. No doorways or desks to leap under, no easy way to get outside. It’s normal to check the huge pillars and high overhead ceiling, looking for cracks. We’ve noted new cracks on the stairs after the 7.1 and laughed. What alternative is there? We have to trust the engineers. You have to trust that a big earthquake won’t happen again. \n———\nOver ten hours after the 6.3, we stop in Ashburton. Still no appetite but I have to eat. The only place open is McDonalds. Inside, there are 40 or 50 evacuees.  An elderly lady in the line seems confused over the trays, waiting empty for hamburger orders. A distressed girl from Invercargill says, “Hey! She’s stealing our receipt!” The older woman steps back and says, “I’m not used to all this.”  I wonder what her story is, alone in McDonalds in Ashburton at 10.30pm.\nWe get to Timaru at 11.30pm, meeting Justine there. We turn on the TV news and talk about people we know are in the CTV building.  I barely sleep that first night. I constantly wake thinking about the people trapped in buildings. I think of one I recently met. In my mind I hold his hand all night, as if that can help.\n———\nOn February 22, two words came to me. Apocalyptic.  Doomed. I thought of the majestic Catholic Basilica with its fallen domes, the Cathedral with its spire on the ground. I understood how in Haiti, why people cried out in terror: “It’s the end of the world!”  \nApocalyptic? For anyone in the earthquake, it describes the moment. But earthquakes give birth to new landscapes. The Port Hills are nearly half a metre higher in places since the earthquake. The earth has its own agenda, and it’s not personal.\nDoomed? No. Ancient cities have come and gone, suffered war, flood, fire and earthquake. Damascus, thought to be the oldest continually inhabited city on earth, has weathered the ups and downs of millennia, earthquakes included. People carry on.\n———\nDay 17: An 8.9 earthquake and terrifying Tsunami strike Japan. Christchurch is off the front page. In my dreams, it’s Japan.",

        "text": "I arrived back in Christchurch, New Zealand, on February 5, 2011. I love this city. I always say it is large enough to have problems, but small enough to think of solutions. The city was doing so well after the 7.1 earthquake on September 4, 2010. All the messes were cleaned up, inspections were almost over, insurance claims were being paid out. Plans for restoration were on the way to being fulfilled. This city was so beautiful I was going to write and tell you so.\nThis annual visit, to see my children and grandson who live here, was a bit later than the usual: I had simply gone for the cheapest ticket from Los Angeles on Air Tahiti Nui, the airline I like to use because the flight is broken up with a short layover in Papeete. Not every day you get to say, “I’ve just been in Tahiti.” \nAfter arriving, I felt a bit fragile at first. I have experienced much emotion in this city. Then I went to the Columbarium Wall to one side of the Cathedral in the Square where, on the other side, its Tower has stood proclaiming for over 150 years, “This is the heart of the city.” But, on the other, darker side, I ran my fingers across the name of my husband who died here: Tom Green (USA) 1947 Creative Artist With his Lord July 4, 2003. \nI had my grounding again. Terra firma.\nThe days would go by quickly I knew, catching up with old and new friends—one whose house was near the Avon River and had suffered quite a bit of damage in the September quake: bricks would be removed, house lifted up and settled again, windows and doors balanced, new drive and walkways.  I was also busy getting that mocha in the morning before walking my seven year-old grandson to school. One friend I knew I wouldn’t see was living and working in Libya. I emailed her to tell her I was here and hoping things were peaceful. “All is quiet here,” she wrote back.\nMost importantly, I wanted our family to eat a meal or two together before the month was over, but especially to catch up with each one individually. It was happening—lunches with the daughter in Lyttelton, the port across the hills from Christchurch, where the first settlers arrived to build a city planned in England. Over to Sumner, a lazy beach town, where one son lives. All the while staying in the suburbs with my other son and his family. \nFive days ago, it was with this son I planned to have lunch after picking him up from his workplace at an insurance company. In the morning I saw my friend from Zimbabwe whose family immigrated to raise their children away from the poverty of dictatorship. She is a nurse in training, doing clinicals in the orthopedic wing, and asked if I could drop her off early so she didn’t have to take the bus into town. She would be at the hospital at 12.30PM rather than 2.30 and study. I was happy to oblige. Easy as, it’s on the way.\nI picked up my son. 12.40PM. Where would we eat? I didn’t want the publicness of Subway. We decided on a busy Satay Noodle House on Riccarton Road, just outside the city centre. We could have gone anywhere. We ordered and sat down to wait. 12.51PM. Suddenly, we were on a distressed cargo plane lumbering clumsily down a runway. No, we were on a freight train, wildly off its tracks. No, we were in the middle of a thunder cloud. I put my hand on my son’s arm and began to pray audibly, but softly. Don’t want to offend. Forks were down. Pots and pans rattled off the walls. Dishes were breaking all around. A man said, “I think we need to be outside.” Everyone followed the leader. Prayer is good. Knowing how to do that AND give good advice is better.\nImmediately after the quaking stopped my son, Joe, said, “We need to get to Isaac’s school.” We walked quickly to the street and the car. People were outside shops. Cars were stopped dead in the road. We saw no falling storefronts. No panic. We were able to arrive at the school within ten minutes. Children sat on the schoolgrounds huddled and cuddled close to their teachers. Some were calm, others were crying. My grandson, the budding scientist, was observing. He saw us and quickly began to describe his experience. \n“Can we help?” we asked the teacher. “No, we are fine,” she said, and gave us permission to take Isaac home. Off we went. At home, we created an outdoor kitchen with foodstuffs and liquids, then checked on the two widows who live to the side and back.\nThe widows were fine—one’s son was on the way. As the afternoon passed, the other came to sit in the car with us: after a particularly strong aftershock, it seemed like a really safe place to be with no overhead power lines. We listened to our wind-up emergency radio. Meanwhile, Joe’s wife, Angie, was in the city, in a building that was now leaning. She had managed to escape with the video equipment necessary to do her job. It took her two hours to get to us. \nThe daughter, working in Lyttelton at an organic foods store, found herself outside, in the street, at the epicenter, watching the town crumble. She walked up the hill to her grand old lady of a house with its views of Diamond Harbour and Quail Island where Scott or Shakleton kept his dogs or ponies before departing for Antarctica. Wanting to travel, she had just found renters and was flatting in the city.  Sitting on the side of a hill, the house was empty, but fine. Back down to the town where she and her boss began handing out the perishables. An Army vessel “just happened” to be in port and began to prepare meals as the tunnel to/from the city was closed down. In the city, she would hear later, the walls of her new place were falling down. But, she was alive and we knew it.\nOver a sleeping lion of a hill, in Sumner, the other son and his town were taking a beating. Huge boulders were falling down onto houses. He would be evacuated as there was a concern due to cracking that the beachfront units would fall into the parking garage below. But, he was alive and we knew it.\nSoon, Isaac’s New Zealand Granddad, a mechanic who is working today inspecting the heavy vehicles necessary for a city to function, and Nana, a nurse who will deliver medicine this weekend to patients in areas covered by liquefaction, arrived—and we all went to Angie’s sister’s house. We were all alive and we knew it.\nIn 1997, Tom and I came to live and work in New Zealand because a regional television station was starting up. The people of Christchurch and the province of Canterbury liked having their own station, watching local people and watching programs of local interest. It was called Canterbury Television or CTV. Joe and Angie met there. It was a struggle, many changes of ownership, and my husband left after only four years to pursue documentary filmmaking. But, Tom left after September 11, 2001. On that day, he linked by phone with a CNN producer/friend and still photos were broadcast while they talked. This was advanced regional television here at the time. Now, less than ten years later, our iphones, the internet and SKYPE are making all the difference in communication.\nStaying on at CTV was our good friend, Paul Wu, the accountant. In those early days, we knew Paul held the place together. There were times when to pay bills or salaries, we knew he did without. He and his wife, Nancy, came to New Zealand from Malaysia to raise their three children. Having been an accountant for a large bank in Malaysia, Paul bought a bicycle shop when they first arrived, knowing this would give him work. The children have done well, one is even an award-winning pianist, and all three are now living and working in London. Nancy now heads up the English as a Second Language department at a high school.\nIf you have been watching the news, the most shocking destruction is of the CTV building. It was seven stories of glass and metal. Paul and the TV station offices were on the first and second floors. When the quake hit, the building collapsed and a fire began. Some of those who were on the top floors were part of a language school. Some found themselves looking at the street and were able to crawl out. At least 22 Japanese students remain in there.\nFor four days now rescue workers from around the world have been working in the cordoned off city centre. The Japanese Rescue Team has been assigned to the CTV building because of those students. We wait to hear of the bodies of the on-air personalities. We wait to hear about those who worked behind the scenes. We wait to hear Paul’s body has been found; Nancy doesn’t give up hope—because Love never does.\nWe are reminded of 9/11. Earthquakes and aftershocks, the earth’s groaning and travailing, reverberations and revolutions are heard round the world. We tremble at something bigger than all of us.\nMy daughter has flown to Wellington to join her long-distance love. My single son is with his girlfriend at her parent’s. I am with Joe’s family at his other Nana’s—Isaac is with both his grandmothers. The adults want to watch all the national and international TV coverage. There is no longer a regional station. The city’s newspaper building was severely damaged, but they manage to print each day. I write to you on the internet. I SKYPE with my husband in America—we were married four years ago in Lyttelton at Holy Trinity, Canterbury’s oldest stone church; it has been destroyed. Text messaging keeps us in contact with those near and far. Landlines, which need no electricity, are at a premium. With each aftershock, we play a game to guess how strong it is. \nIt’s a sunny day. It’s summer. Flowers are in bloom. Children are in the parks. Children have to play. Paul and Nancy’s children are on their way from London. People are being evacuated from Libya. The Cathedral Tower has crumbled. The Columbarium Wall still stands. \nThe Mayor and the Prime Minister say, “We will rebuild the city. It will be a different one.”  \nWe are alive and know it.",

        "text": "It is so long since February that I have hesitated to add my ‘yet another tale’ to the list but  I was in NZ again last month and some great friends in Wellington have persuaded me, so …  well I am a Brit who lives in France but has family near Auckland.  I was doing a circuit of the South Island in February and had just dropped off my rental car and checked in my luggage at Christchurch airport around 11am on the 22nd. Instead of waiting there for my flight to Auckland at 3pm I decided to take the bus down to town to have lunch, which I did, in a first-floor food hall near Ballantynes, where I also had a good conversation with a local couple whose table I shared. I was walking along High Street, almost at Cathedral Square when it happened. \n\nThe thing that stays in my memory most of all is – oddly perhaps – the noise: like a fleet of noisy trucks with rattly cargoes but seeming to come from all directions. Initially I looked around, as I could not figure out what it was, and then the ground started to move. It was at that point that I realised something beyond my experience was occurring and that it would be a good idea to get into clear ground, away from buildings – so like so many others, I walked quickly to the centre of the square as everything started to rattle and the ground swayed: it was like trying to walk along the deck of a moving boat. Those who have never experienced a quake seem to think that the ground just vibrates a bit – rather like standing up in a train, but perhaps more violently. It is hard to describe to them the magnitude of the up-and-down, and side-to-side movements that so affect your balance.\n Looking around, I watched the cupola on the corner of the tourist office sway, and bits drop off, hardly noticing  the noise and cloud of dust as the cathedral spire collapsed behind me. When that dust settled I was speechless at the sight. It is astonishing to think that all of that happened in just over 20 seconds-or-so; and It was only after that I thought of taking photographs. Despite what some of the press would have the world believe, I was struck by the lack of panic – just one or two people clutching each other but the rest, like me, somewhat shocked but calm. I rang my sister in Auckland to tell her what had just happened and said I doubted I’d see her that evening. I hadn’t at that point figured that if everyone did the same, the telephone networks would be saturated.\nI thought it prudent to get out of the city so with many others, local and otherwise, started to walk up towards the airport (which I reached in just over an hour on foot, for those tempted to do it in the future!). I was by the Avon when the second shock hit. Across Hagley Park the liquefaction was already present and I have the grey-stained shoes to prove it. Walking past the city centre streets I was impressed at how quickly the orange gilets appeared, streets were cordoned off and a whole lot of safety precautions set in motion. I didn’t realise it at the time but if I had turned my head at certain points I could have seen the collapsed PGG building and the shaky Grand Chancellor. At that point I had a dilemma: I am a Red Cross first-aider (in France) and my thought was to offer help to the authorities… but then I thought that I had no proof with me of my qualification and might be seen as just another well-meaning tourist who would in fact hinder, rather than help, recovery, quite apart from putting myself in danger (which would not worry me, but might worry the authorities). So instead I kept on walking to the airport. I later felt extremely guilty about this, but it was by then too late to do a U-turn.\nAt the airport, and the Sudima hotel, given the general confusion and worried enquiries from hundreds of tourists from dozens of nations, speaking as many languages, I thought the organisation was remarkably good. (If there is any criticism, it is that Air NZ’s initial reaction was slow –  the phone lines and the associated call centre(s), especially were woefully inadequate.) That said, once everything got going, it all went smoothly and after a night spent with some lovely people in a camper van loaned by Backpackers (thank you very much!), which wobbled almost constantly as the aftershocks hit every few minutes, Air NZ got me back to AKL by lunchtime the next day.\nI still wonder what happened to the couple I had lunch with. I hope and pray that they and everyone else in the food court got out unscathed.",

Each time there was an accident on the tracks and someone pulled the emergency brake handle, the train grinded to a halt with a quivering, violent and jerky movement accompanied by that sharp, metallic noise produced by the brake shoes against the iron wheels. This time, I wasn’t in a train.

        "text": "Although well into old age I still work as a Registered Nurse. I was 17 kilometres away from home on the 22 of Feb. on duty in a private hospital in Sumner.  I was due off duty but stayed around for a while helping to clean up after the massive jolt. There was no phone contact with my adult children. Rocks could be heard coming down towards Sumner. Our brave Manager drove around to see how bad the damage was. It was 3pm. I had to leave in the tinyiest car in New Zealand to try and get to North Brighton. I knew bridges were out and roads broken. I had heard that the cathedral was down and rocks had crashed on a bus. I knew rocks were coming down the hillsides onto the roads I had too travel on. I had to check my kids and my poor dog that was locked inside my house—-if it was still standing close to QE2 stadium. A stream of traffic was leaving Sumner. My little car was rocking and rolling with each aftershock, and more rocks and shingle was falling down the banks. As I approached the Ferrymead bridge I was gob smacked. Hundreds of people were walking towards Redcliffs. Some had their shoes in their hands. They all looked shocked. One lady was hysterical. It looked like the crowds walking home in New York on 9/11. I couldn’t understand. I didnt know what was happening in Christchurch. I had to head for the Heathcote valley as my car couldn’t cross the damaged bridge. Many people were out on the roads in little huddles too scared to go inside because of the after shocks and two scared to stay out because of the rocks.\nMy little car struggled through damaged  cracked roads. Some times the footpath and rocks were an alternative to the road. The sea was miles out and although it was now 3 hours since the quake it looked ominious. Surely we can’t get a tsunami now. At last I was in Opawa where my daughter lived. Water every where as the Heathcote was trying to breach its banks. I found the family in tears but ok. Back out to my now muddy little red Diahatsu. Back down River Law terrace more terrified of the water than anything. On to the motorway across to Brighton. We barely moved. It was gridlock. At the hospital in Linwood Ave I was amazed to see a taxi barely visable in the gate way almost covered with liqufaction.  An hour later outside a stadium a sink hole contained a station wagon. I was very close. I didn’t want to go in too. The liqufaction and water became worse. The traffic was massive. Lower Pages Road was covered in water from the Avon. Was I going to get through. I was very scared at this stage The water was up the side of my door. It must have covered my exhust. What if the engine stopped. I crept really close to the car in front. Where he went I followed. I just hoped he could see holes in the road I couldn’t see. When he dodged around something I followed. It was really scary. Conditions were deterioating. \nAt last I got up on the bridge into Brighton. What an advert for the tiniest car in New Zealand. My heart was beating wildly. It was the only time I was really scared. Down Keyes road was like a drive down the sandhills on the beach. Lots of water, lots of sand and a few people. Into Bower Ave. and I could see a great hole at the entrace to my street. I struggled through Bower Ave. I felt sick . My house would be gone. Many were. I skirted around the great sink hole which contained a Toyota. My house was still standing. Inside every thing was on the ground but my terrified dog had managed to dodge the falling furniture. All night this big dog clung to me in my little bed. We had no power no toilet and no water and I had many jars of jam on the floor to clean up but we had survived. \nThe earth quake had a sting in its tail. A few days later a gas camp stove blew up in my kitchen, blowing the dog through the ranch slider, and causing more damage then any earthquake. I would have been another eathquake causality according to the firemen who attended. I had just started my walk back to the house from the Portaloo when my house exploded and windows and doors blew open or out. My neighbour thought it was the Grand Chanellor falling. I shook for quite a while, and even now jump if I hear a loud noise. My heavily coated dog  survived amazingly, but lands on my bed with a leap if anything unforseen occurs. She is very nervous . I just hope we can all get back to normal soon.",

I touch the touchlamp. For a split second there is light, then the power goes. Dash down the hallway, and I hear glasses and plates smashing in the kitchen. ‘Shit, this is a big one!’ i say. “I’ve got L (daughter)” says the hubby- hell, my son N – I am barely awake but my heart is pounding….dunno how I get my 11mth out of the cot but I do and am back in the doorway of his nursery. He is limp and nonresponsive..is he alive – what was above him? Oh shit, bigger shaking. This time I have to brace myself with my backbone against the jamb and my toes on the other – as I have both hands holding my son. [I got nerve damage to my big toe from this- 6 mths of numbness]. My husband has the cellphone on radio via speaker. We keep saying to each other ‘Poor buggers in Wellington – this is the BIG ONE!’...then we find out it is 40km west – WHERE?? No fault there. The shaking finally stops. My son now waks up and screams for milk. There is no way to heat the stuff in the fridge, and no water for a warmer formula….screaming child, crying child, we fall into our big bed. Listening to the radio and people out Kaiapoi and Brighton way say we have sunk 1/2 a metre- seawater everywhere… [actually liquifaction, but who knew?]...I doze in and out of aftershocks, not really sleeping. Around 5.30 there is a helipcopter overhead, then the neighbours arrive. Power back on around 10am, water about 3pm…\nDec 26 2010 – another big shake, and now the chimney has a large crack. Bit worried bout that…\nJan 21 2011- EQC call for the Assessment. Happy to see them, but I know we aren’t the worst hit – what’s going on? They tell us the chimney looks OK, just a crack. They go into the atticspace and shake it – “Don’t worry, it’s safe as, that is solid, won’t be moving in a hurry” \nFeb 22 2011 – We are all out of the house – thank god as the Chimney DID fall, and into the kids bedroom. So did all the bookcases, spilling contents across doors and over beds! [They are now firmly secured as is all other dressers and such…]\nI am at work, enjoying the end of the lunch break. A colleague remarked about 12.30pm “we haven’t had many shakes for a while, eh – must be settling down” – she is NEVER allowed to say such things again! \n12.51 – it starts like a normal shock, but then after about 2sec it is clear this is NOT an aftershock – the power goes out and serious shake sounds. I dive under the table. There are about 10 of us sitting round a board table at the University of Canterbury. Only three of us get under it (all female); the males all run to the walls, benches, doors and window latches to hold on -WTF!?? Except our HR manager – straight out the door. He’s a flighter… I am full of adrenaline and giggly  – I can conquer the world, but can’t think clearly. Outside we have bets on what it was – I think 5.8-5.9; other’s think 8.0…we are laughing and joking to dispel nerves and adrenaline. Security tell us to leave. I drive home – which takes about 21/2 hrs, usually 15mins… Naively I think the traffic is just cos of the Uni closure. I txt my husband to pick up the kids, as, working in Cashel st, he won’t be so badly impacted….\nI don’t get a response. I flick on the radio to hear 2 buildings collapsed and the spire of the cathedral has fallen – sad. {I still have no clue how bad this is….}. On Wights Road I hit liquefaction bubbling out of the road – shit, that is weird. As I cross over Lincoln road into Lyttleton st, a caller states “Don’t go down Lyttleton st – it is a mess” – Great….I hit severe liquifaction on Barrington st, on Whychbury Barrington cnr there is a house with liquifaction POURING out from under the garage door! More on Coronation, hell…\n\nI get home to see my husband and kids in the driveway- along with the Chimney and roofing bits. THANK GOD!!\n“There’s liquifaction all down barrington adn Coronation, and Selwyn shops are all come down” \n“Honey – that is NOTHING compared to the city”.... I never want to hear that tone of voice again. A shocking tale of walking out of the city – but that is his one to tell.",

The class was just about to be told what to do for Thursday’s class and then the quake hit. At first I thought that it was just another aftershock, but when the power went out and the room felt like someone picked it up and bouncing it around, I realized that I needed to get under my desk, which was unfortunately a very thick wooden one. The shaking got worse but eventually it stopped. I thought that that aftershock had been a particularly powerful one. Five seconds once the quake had ended, we were all ordered to get out of the building, so I grabbed my textbook and my bag and ran for my life out of the Commerce Building. I did not even stop to look at the tiles that had ripped off the wall. My mind was already racing and fearing. \nWe all got outside and were all evacuated to the Ilam fields. Then the first aftershock hit. All you could hear were people screaming. Some laughing for some reason. I must have spent fifteen minutes walking around University in a daze trying to figure out what to do. It was then that a student told me that that aftershock was 6.3 on the Richter scale and located in Lyttelton which would explain why it shook like hell at University. The student also told me that the cathedral’s spire had come down and that one person was already reported as dead. At first I thought that this was just a rumor, but it did manage to make me make my way down to Christchurch Hospital to see if my family was OK.\nI began a very daunting walk down Riccarton Road. I felt like I was walking in a daze. What I saw was broken buildings and people running out of Riccarton Mall. I made my way to the end of Riccarton Road and was just about to go to Christchurch Hospital when another aftershock struck causing me to hold onto a fence. This was the one time in my life that I feared that I would die. This aftershock kind of made me run into South Hagley Park. I spent hours trying to navigate amongst distressed citizens, tourists, and children. Eventually I saw the Museum and realized that I was close to Christchurch Hospital. My hopes lifted, I ignored the warning from the military of crossing the bridge and just ran to Christchurch Hospital. I made it to my family and got a big hug from my Mum. This seemed to say everything. \nHaving found my family, we made our way to St. Martins which looked like a swamp. There was liquefaction everywhere, and part of the St Martins library had collapsed. My grandparents were too traumatized to say anything. I had never seen them look so upset. At six o’clock we decided to leave. What would normally be a twenty minute ride from St Martins to Burwood turned into a three and a half hour drive. I saw the west wall of Linwood mall leaning on a pole. This was another sign that this quake was much worse than the quake on September 4th in 2010. Later that night we made it home. The house was still standing, but I was not prepared for the mess inside. Everything had just fallen on the floor, books had done the Domino effect in my room. We didn’t have power that night. We all tried to eat something, but we all felt sick upon hearing the stories that dead bodies were being pulled from the CTV Building. The power didn’t come back until Thursday afternoon. It was then that the full extent of the damage made itself apparent. The death toll had reached 100 and was expected to rise. \nTime seemed slow after the earthquake. The trauma from that day in February never seems to leave. Everywhere you go, the damage caused from the February quake is apparent…",

        "text": "I was in my final year of high school in 2010. Like everyone else, I lived through September 4th, and the aftermath. My school had areas that were damaged, but nothing significant. Then. After February, though, I found out that the department I had spent the majority of my five high school years in was to be demolished and is now gone, which was particularly hard. Also my nearby church, a central part of my life since I was a very young child was quite badly damaged and possibly may not be able to be rebuilt on the same site.\nBut life after September continued, as it does. With a geologist for a father, he assured me that in all likelihood the worst was behind us and, because of the evidence in other cases, the aftershocks would eventually dissipate, getting weaker and weaker. Our house was miraculously fine, and so were we. Everyone was tentatively hopeful, and happy we’d all got through this alive.\nFast forward to February 21st. I had just arrived at my new University of Victoria hostel. I was meeting new people and engaged in beginning my tertiary studies, having almost completely overcome a serious (incurable) disease that had finally been diagnosed towards the end of 2010. Stress was one of the factors in my wellbeing and this disease, and I was glad I could move on and away from that and the aftershocks. As I hugged my father goodbye as he left for Christchurch again, I had no thoughts that I might fear for his life less than twenty-four hours later.\nI was in the middle of my first introductory lecture when I got a tweet from a Christchurch friend. It was a comment on a ‘big’ aftershock. Everyone gets of Facebook and Twitter to talk about the aftershocks and debate how big they were, so I ignored it. I had more important things to think about. \nI was just about to turn off my phone when I got a text from my father. \n“Big quake. Lots of deaths. I was in town and buildings collapsed around me.” \nI couldn’t get in contact with the rest of my family for the next five-and-a-half hours. Now, I’m not the sort of person who usually is prone to emotional outbursts, especially not in public with people I don’t know, but I instantly burst into tears. I knew my father was in the central city and that my mother and brothers were who knows where else. I had no idea how widespread the destruction was, or even how big the quake was. I was terrified. \nI ran out, and up the hill to my hall as fast as I could. I tried, but I couldn’t stop crying. True, I tend to horriblize, but for all I knew, my entire city, my entire family was gone. It’s how I felt right then. \nLuckily, when I arrived at the hall, they had set up a separate TV room for Canterbury people only that was showing the news as it unfolded. There were plenty of tissues, and by the time my friends and family had started replying to my texts I had calmed down. \nLogically, I knew that I had—and have—everything to be grateful for. Compared to others, I have lost comparatively little—important places, yes, but neither immediate family or friends, nor my house. Hell, I wasn’t even IN Christchurch when the “big one” hit—I don’t carry all that trauma, which I even feel guilty for, and churlish for mourning the only city I’ve ever truly called home. I guess that’s some form of survivor’s guilt.\nAs it turns out, I’ve come back to Christchurch to live. I miss the city I grew up in terribly. I didn’t know that it was possibly to mourn something so much, something that wasn’t a person or alive. But really, Christchurch was and is a living thing. We make it so. I want to tenaciously cling to the memories I have and, hopefully form some new ones that will help stitch up the ache that comes when I think about what Christchurch once was.",

As I was watching Two and a Half Men, and drinking coke, the room started to violently shake and the TV turned off. Unsure of what to do, I ran to the phone in tears to call my mum. It was a 5.7 magnitude. I calmed myself down, and then returned to the couch to watch the rest of my DVD. About 45 minutes later, the same thing happened; but this time twice as violent. A window smashed, a giant wooden cupboard fell over and the TV once again switched off. This time I knew it was serious and ran to the street to find help. I couldn’t see anyone that I knew and I was too shy to ask a stranger. I put my face in my hands and cried until a lovely neighbour came over and hugged me. I waited at her house until I could contact someone, and it was at least 2 hours before my dad finally came home, and told me it was a 6.3, centred 5 minutes from my house.

        "text": "The same old Tuesday, getting up at 7:30am, getting prepared for school. I remember it as if it were only yesterday, clear as a daisy. Little did we know that this day would soon change our lives. Walking to school with Maia as per usual, just another day at school. Today we were aware that the teachers of all high schools had to attend a meeting in the town hall. School was planned to finish at 12, as it did, the majority of students flooded out of schools and were scattered around all the malls and social places. Me, I was walking down to the McDonald’s restaurant on Riccarton Rd. We had just walked in and you could see all of the students from various school ordering lunch. \nThen as us girls stood in line all you could see were the lights starting to shake, then girls started to scream. Everyone grabbed everyone, strangers, friends, family, anyone and everyone were holding onto each other as the shaking continued for what felt like forever. After it stopped I was adamant on getting to my mother’s work with my close friend Aleni. Once we reached her work the New Zealand Blood Service, she was already busy at work transferring blood to the many casulties already arriving at Christchurch Hospital. Many calls and tears later, the word had arisen that my auntie Olivia was stuck in a lift by herself and had been stuck in there for at least two hours until rescued. My grandad, whose house is located right on top of the fault line had received major damage. \nOur family home only had cracks but our family decided to evacuate and everyone in our family aunties, uncles, cousin, and grandparents re-located to my youngest auntie and her little family. Instead of the healthy dinner that she was preparing we all brought things out of our freezers of our own homes and had a lovely dinner as her house had regained water and power in the moments after the big shake. We used the spa as our shower as we were unaware of the water pipes. As we watched the news and the little kids went to bed, all you could see were the pictures re-played over and over again. This is when we realised how lucky we came out. In the later days we returned home aprt from my grandparents who were then permanent residents of my aunties home. As weeks went on, bodies were found and it really brought our whole community together. My friends and I continuously went to the Student Army to help out the people of Christchurch where we were put into buses and driven throughout the hardest hit suburbs to lend a helping hand. As the months passed everyone got back on their feet and came to terms with our new city.",

        "text": "Entries from my blog after the February earthquake:\n\nPosted 22 February 2011, 3 pm\n\nAnother big earthquake\n\nI’m ok, and made it home from work. No damage at home – just a couple of minor breakages again – but the centre of the city is a mess and they reckon there’s been multiple deaths.\n\nAmazingly, we’ve still got power on in our suburb, but the phones are out, and I think we’ll be boiling water again.\n\nThis is horrific.\nPosted 23 February 2011, 9 am\n\nWe’re evacuating \n\nNot because we’re in any danger, but to try and relieve some of the pressure on water, sewerage etc. They’ve asked for anyone who has somewhere else they can go for a few days to do so, so Dad texted us and offered to come up and pick us up and take us down to Alexandra. So we’re packing a few clothes (and the cat!) and we’ll be heading away this afternoon.\n\nI wish there was something practical to do to help, but as there’s not (I can’t even donate blood, because I’m a BSE risk), the next best thing I can do is help by not being here.\n\nGot about 5 hours sleep last night in between the aftershocks. I can’t stop obsessively watching the news on TV and reading Stuff – probably not the healthiest thing to be doing, but just like in September, I’m trying to convince myself that this is really happening to my city.\n\nHaven’t heard yet from Jenny or Philip, who gave me a lift home yesterday before heading out in search of their respective partners who they hadn’t been able to contact – one in Sumner, the other in Lyttelton, both badly affected areas. I know the lack of communication is probably just because they have no power or phones, but I really want to know Christian and Annie are ok.\n\nSorry this is so disjointed – I’ll try and write a proper account of yesterday once I settle down a bit. \n\n(Update 11 am: Just heard from Jenny – she and Christian are ok. So glad to hear that. I’ve offered them the use of our house while we’re away if their place is unliveable.)\nPosted 24 February 2011 \n\nChecking in\n\nWe’re down in Alexandra, and feeling much better after a good night’s sleep and a relaxing day. Thanks everyone for your kind thoughts and wishes – it really does help enormously to know that people are thinking of you.\n\nI saw several flags flying at half mast around town today, and it was strangely affecting.\n\n…\n\nI’m guessing you’ve all seen the news coverage of what’s happening in Christchurch. So many deaths and horrific injuries, and so many people still trapped. I’ve heard (either directly or indirectly) from all my close friends and most of my workmates now, so know they’re ok, but I also know the chances are, in a city of only half a million, that all of us will end up knowing someone who is a victim. And probably everyone in our tiny country will know someone who’s lost someone – already I’ve heard that the owners of a shop near my brother’s have lost their son.\n\nIt’s still hard to get my head around the fact that what I’m seeing on TV is Christchurch. It may not be the city I was born in, but it’s the place I’ve lived longer than anywhere else in my nomadic life, and it definitely feels like home now. How could something like this happen to my town? Not only to be losing precious old buildings like we did in September, but for people to be dying under them. I keep thinking that the pictures on TV are from some foreign city, but then I recognise the buildings, and can work out exactly where the camera person must be standing to shoot the film – it’s all so familiar and yet so unreal.\n\nI do feel a bit guilty having come down here, like I’m somehow letting down everyone who doesn’t have the chance to leave, by not staying put and sticking it out with them, but it really was the most sensible thing to do. We know from our experience in September how tough the first week is, with little sleep, restricted water supplies, not being able to flush the toilet or have a shower, and shortages in the supermarkets. By leaving we’re not only reducing the strain on the city’s services, but also giving ourselves time to rest and recover a bit of calm so when we do go back we’ll be more ready to maybe help out in some way.\n\nI really will write a full account of what Tuesday was like, but not today.\nPosted 1 March 2011 \n\nBack home\n\nWe’re back in Christchurch, and feeling much refreshed and ready to face whatever this city throws at us. Dad drove us up yesterday, with a car load of food, water, and camping gear – some for us, some for friends in need.\n\n…\n\nWe got as far as Hornby without incident, but then hit the traffic. What would normally be a 10 minute drive from Hornby to our place took well over half an hour there was so much traffic on the by-pass, all crawling along. At our place we let the cat out and quickly unloaded our share of the food etc, then headed over to Ferrymead to meet Jenny (who lives in Sumner, so has been without power or water for a week, and unlikely to get either back soon). We’d originally been going to drive right out to Sumner, but she rang us to say they’d just closed the Sumner road because they’re worried more of Redcliffs might collapse, so the only route out was over the Summit Road, and they’re restricting that to residents. So we arranged to meet in Ferrymead, and told her we’d be there in half an hour or so. Yeah, we didn’t take the traffic into account. It was actually more like an hour and a quarter – lucky she was sensible enough to bring a book to read while she waited for us!\n\nIt was weird travelling out that way – there was no visible damage at all until we reached the corner of Brougham and Antigua streets, and then we started to see the odd crumbled wall or chimney. Then we started to see the silt from the liquefaction. We were travelling on major roads, which had already been cleared, but there were huge piles of silt along the sides of the road, and the smell was awful – obviously there was sewerage mixed in with the sand and mud. Everything is covered in grey dust now that the silt is starting to dry out and blow around (they’re advising that people with respiratory conditions wear masks – I reckon everyone should, given what’s in that dust!). All the streets leading off Brougham towards the city centre were cordoned off, with soldiers standing guard, and when you looked down the streets towards the city all you could see were huge clouds of dust, obviously being stirred up by the rescue/recovery efforts, and rubble lying across the roads. A sobering sight. As we got further east, the roads got worse. As it’s a major route they’ve filled in the major potholes with gravel, but the road surface was still all buckled, with weird humps and dips all along it. Really strange looking.\n\nAt Ferrymead we met Jenny, hugs were exchanged, and supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables and camping gear gratefully received (I’d rung her to get a shopping list while we were in Alexandra). She was looking pretty stressed, as they’re just living day to day waiting to hear if they’ll be the next street to be evacuated (I of course offered her our place as a refuge if that happens, or if they just can’t stand the strain of waiting any longer).\n\nNext stop was in Bromley, where Dad’s friend Graham works. He owns a construction firm, so we met him in their yard. Outside was an enormous pile of silt cleared from their yard (about the size of the piles of gravel you see when they’re constructing a road), and he showed us the corners of the yard where they still haven’t cleared all the silt – it was nearly half a metre deep. We had more fruit for him (we’d stopped at an orchard in Cromwell on the way up), and some equipment he needed.\n\nAs we were standing in the yard talking, an aftershock struck. It was only a tiny one, just a single jolt, but incredibly strong. It felt like the ground dropped away beneath us. I leapt about a mile in the air, and grabbed onto the nearest solid object (Dad’s arm :-)). Later when I checked GeoNet I found out that it had been small, only 3.3, but it was only 2 km deep, and centred just about directly under where we were standing – no wonder it felt so scary!\n\n…\n\nA few minor aftershocks last night, but nothing dramatic, so it’s feeling surreally back to normal here now. But I just have to think back to what we saw yesterday (and remember that was only the very edge of the damage) to bring back to mind just how bad things really are. I’ve been trying to think of things I can do to help out – we’ve put our name down to billet a student if needed, and I think I’ll probably do some baking later and take it to one of the aid centres.\nPosted 2 March 2011\n\n…\n\nwe have postal services again!!! We got our first delivery yesterday, a week after the earthquake. \n\nWe also had a visitor yesterday – someone from Search and Rescue knocked on the door (don’t worry, I checked his ID!) asking if we needed any help. They said on the news the other day that they’d be going round houses checking everyone was ok, but I assumed they only meant in the badly affected suburbs. But no, they’re doing the entire city!\n\nI did promise a description of the earthquake, didn’t I? Seeing as it’s now 8 days later, I suppose I should do that now, before I forget the details (not that I think I will – I’m sure that day will stay with me for a long time!).\n\nThe morning was a pretty ordinary one. The students had only started back the day before, so I’d spent most of it answering questions and directing lost first-years. Normally on a day like that I would have escaped at lunchtime to make sure I got a proper break, but it was drizzling, so I decided to eat lunch at my desk and put up with the interruptions.\n\nI hadn’t quite finished eating when the shaking started – I’d seen a couple of students in the corridor coming towards my office, so I’d turned away from my lunch to see what they needed. As soon as the earthquake started, I knew it was going to be a big one. Normally when there’s an aftershock you don’t react for a few seconds as you wait to see if it’s going to get big or not, but with this one it was big right from the start. It felt different than the September one – more of an up and down movement, whereas September was side to side. The best way I’ve been able to describe it is as being like when you were a kid and you’d sit on a trampoline while someone else was bouncing, and you’d be thrown around uncontrollably.\n\nI immediately tried to get under my desk, but I was being thrown around so much it was difficult. I kept bumping my head on the bottom of the desk as I bounced up and down, and must have hit my arm as well (though I didn’t notice it at the time), because I ended up with a huge bruise. The noise was unbelievable – as well as the low-frequency rumble from the ground, there were all sorts of creaks and moans from the building, and the sound of things falling down everywhere. I could see things flying off the shelves opposite me, and I worried about the two students, because where they’d been standing out in the reception area there was nothing to shelter under.\n\nI’ve got no idea how long the shaking lasted (it always feels much longer than it actually is!), but when it stopped I crawled back out from under the desk and saw the students huddled together beside the reception area’s couch, arms covering their heads and thankfully unharmed. The building was still standing, but it was a mess though – all the ceiling tiles had come down in the corridor again, and the hanging sign outside my office had broken and was hanging by only one chain. I didn’t have much time to look around though, because it was obvious we’d have to evacuate.\n\nA few people have said that the September earthquake actually turned out to be a good thing, and it’s true, because our experiences then taught us so much. One thing the university learnt is that our evacuation procedures, designed for fire, wouldn’t work in an earthquake, because all the evacuation points were too close to buildings, so anyone standing there would be endangered by falling glass (or even buildings). Over the summer the Health and Safety team had been redesigning the procedures, and only a couple of weeks ago I’d been to a training session where they told us our new evacuation points (in the centre of large carparks or playing fields well away from any buildings), and what the procedures would be once we got there. During the training, someone asked how we’d know if we needed to evacuate after an aftershock, and the trainer basically said “if it happens, you’ll know”.\n\nShe was right – we all knew there was no way we were staying in the building, so we headed for the stairs. I remembered to grab my bag as I left (otherwise I’d have been without such essentials as my phone and my wallet), and glanced around my desk wondering if there was anything else I needed to take. I must have been in shock, because instead of picking up something sensible like my keys, my diary (otherwise known as my lifeline – it contains absolutely everything I need to know), my water bottle, or even the book I was reading, the one thing I picked up was my mp3 player. Yeah, really essential survival equipment there Jennifer!\n\nAs we left, we were knocking on office doors to make sure nobody was trapped inside. One person was trapped – his books had fallen off the bookshelves (which are secured to the wall) and landed in front of his door so he couldn’t pull it open. But my boss and one of the postgrads put their shoulders to it and managed to force it open to let him out.\n\nThere’s supposed to be emergency lighting in the buildings that comes on when the power goes out, but for some reason it wasn’t working, so the stairwell was very dark. We got to the bottom ok though, and started directing the confused looking students who were milling around to the new evacuation point. I’d been doubtful when we were told about the evacuation plans, whether it really would be possible to get 12,000 students and staff to safety. But from what I saw of our area of campus it worked really well (and I later heard that there were no serious injuries anywhere on campus) – those of us who remembered the new procedures directed those who didn’t, and we basically herded everyone out to the carpark, picking up strays as we went along.\n\nThe only part of the plan that failed was that our carpark didn’t have a warden. They’d been asking for volunteers the week before, and ours was the last evacuation point that still hadn’t had someone appointed. So we all milled around for a while waiting for someone official to tell us what to do next. Everyone had their cell phones out, of course, desperately trying to contact family, but the network was obviously overloaded, because no calls were getting through. At first we didn’t realise how bad it had been, and were joking about how come the aftershock couldn’t have waited for a nicer day (it was still drizzling), but then texts started to get through and word started to spread about how bad it was in town. H texted me pretty quickly to let me know he was ok, which was a huge relief. A lot of people had left their phones in their offices, so those of us who did have them were sharing them around.\n\nThe first big aftershock to the aftershock hit while we were standing in the carpark – a 5.7, which is bigger than any of the aftershocks to the original earthquake. It was a huge jolt, and all of us grabbed hold of the nearest person (whether we knew them or not :-)). I ended up in a group hug with a few of the women from the college office. The cars in the carpark were bouncing around madly, totally lifting off the ground – really scary!\n\nEventually someone from security arrived, and told us they were shutting down the campus, and that we should all go home. There were a few people upset that they couldn’t go back into the buildings and retrieve their belongings first (especially people who’d left their car keys behind!), but security weren’t taking any chances on another aftershock hitting, so turned them away.\n\nI contemplated walking home, but I was still feeling pretty shaky, and wasn’t too keen on being on my own for the 40-odd minutes it would take to walk. So when I heard Phil offering Jenny a lift home, I asked if he’d mind dropping me off too. They were both concerned about their partners, Phil’s wife being at home in Lyttelton, and Jenny’s husband on his way from Sumner by bike, without a phone. I gave Phil my phone to keep trying his wife as we drove, but there was nothing I could do to help Jenny other than try and reassure her.\n\nThe traffic was horrendous, with everyone trying to get home or to their children’s schools, so it took nearly an hour to reach my place. It would have been faster for me to walk! Everyone was being very good though – there was no road rage, and nobody was trying to overtake or block cars joining the road, but just patiently crawling along, happy just to be moving at all.\n\nWhen we got home H was watching the news on TV (amazingly, we didn’t lose power at all this time) – it was such a shock to see what was happening in town, when this side of the city looked completely normal. I gave Phil H’s phone (as parents etc who’d be wanting to check on us would be more likely to call mine) so he could keep trying his wife, and found a jersey for Jenny (who was going into shock and shivering uncontrollably), and made sure they had water, then they headed out again to try and reach Lyttelton or Sumner.\n\n(I heard from Jenny a couple of days later that Sumner was completely cut off, but they’d managed to get over Dyer’s Pass to Lyttelton, then Jenny borrowed a pair of gym shoes off Phil’s wife and walked over the hill to Sumner (note for non-Christchurch people, this is a serious hike, that takes a few hours on a good day). A couple of people were killed by falling rocks trying to do the same thing, so she was incredibly lucky to make it.)\n\nThe rest of the afternoon we were glued to the TV. Outside, the traffic jam in our street (which is a major route out of town) continued until well into the evening, and there was a constant sound of sirens in the distance and helicopters overhead. There were a few big aftershocks through the afternoon, but nothing too scary, and amazingly we once again escaped any damage – I think the only casualty this time was one wine glass.\n\nSo, that was February 22nd, a date that will I think be engraved in every Cantabrian’s mind for ever.\nPosted 16 March 2011 \n\nHotdesking\n\nLife continues to be strange. The horrifying pictures from Japan make our earthquake seem so minor, which in a way is reassuring – it could have been so much worse – but also kind of scary – it could have been so much worse!\n\nJust as after September, now that the initial drama has died down, what’s left is mostly tiredness and depression. Life is just hard work – everything seems to take twice as long as it did before the earthquake, and is much more complicated. Even something as simple as going shopping is complicated – for a start you have to allow twice as much time as normal to get there, because the buses aren’t really running to a regular timetable yet, so you pretty much have to guess when one will arrive and just go to the bus stop and hope for the best (so far the longest I’ve had to wait is about half an hour – good thing I had a book!) At least the buses are free at the moment, which makes the waiting much more bearable :-)\n\nTravelling by car isn’t much better, because the traffic is still pretty awful (people aren’t exactly heeding the constant calls to limit car use or at least carpool), so it takes forever to get anywhere. And in large parts of the city the roads are in really bad condition, which slows the traffic down even more. I went over to Hillsborough (which is deep in the heart of portaloo country) the other day with a colleague for a meeting, and it took us about an hour to get there from Ilam, partly because of the traffic, but also because the roads are all warped and cracked, so we had to keep slowing down to avoid potholes and negotiate the bumps.\n\nThat sort of thing is getting on everyone’s nerves, and everyone’s getting a bit scratchy and irritable (I saw two cars driving side by side down Riccarton Road the other day with the drivers having a shouting match through their open windows). But then you look at what’s happening in Japan, and our little problems and inconveniences seem so trivial in comparison, which of course then makes you feel guilty for not coping better, which makes you feel even worse.\n\nOk, this is turning into some sort of pity fest, which isn’t at all what I set out to write! It’s really not all bad – there’s still all the good stuff like people banding together as communities and looking after each other, and all sorts of incredible acts of generosity. \n\nI’ve been back at work this week – well, sort of. Our building still hasn’t been cleared by the engineers, so we’ve been allocated a single office (for our whole department!) in one of the few campus buildings that has been certified safe. Our new office has only got three desks and one working computer, so we’re practising what the managers are calling “hotdesking” (i.e. what normal people would call “sharing”) and doing a lot of working from home. I’ve been going in for a few hours a day (mainly to deal with student enquiries), and otherwise trying to get as much work as I can done from home (the wonders of the internet age – I can log in remotely to the university’s servers from anywhere and access all my files and things), which has its advantages and disadvantages (and many distractions!).\n\nWe were allowed to go back into our building briefly today to grab any essential records and teaching materials. Because the building is possibly unsafe (it looks ok, but some of the other buildings they’ve inspected turned out to have hidden structural damage, so they’re not taking any chances), we were only allowed to go in a few people at a time, escorted by a search and rescue team. And we had to wear hard hats and hi-vis vests – never thought I’d be wearing those to work!!! We were only allowed about 5 minutes in our offices to grab as much as we could carry (we’d all sensibly come equipped with suitcases and backpacks :-)), then we were taken back outside. My office wasn’t in as bad a state as I thought it might be – a lot of stuff on the floor, and I think my potplants are done for, but at least all of the furniture stayed upright this time. The cracks in the internal (non structural) walls that still hadn’t been repaired from September look even more impressive now – one was the whole width of the room! (No photos, sorry – I didn’t have time, being too busy trying to grab everything I could think of that we might need over the next few weeks).\n\nSome people were feeling really anxious about going back into the building, but I wasn’t too worried – or at least, I thought I wasn’t, but it obviously had more of an effect than I thought, because I realised a few hours later that I was feeling utterly exhausted.\n\nWe’ve got no idea when (or if!) we’ll be allowed to go back in – it depends on what the engineers find when they start looking closely at the supporting beams and stuff. I’m hoping that by the time I get back from America it will be all sorted out and we’ll be allowed to move back in. In the meantime, we’ll just have to cope with camping out in our tiny office (at least we’re not literally camping out like some departments, which are having to work out of tents!)\n\nIt does feel good to be back at work at last, though. It feels like life is at least slowly starting to get back to normal – or what the VC keeps calling “a new kind of normal”. \nPosted 16 March 2011 \n\nI’m back!\n\nThe engineers signed off on our building on Friday afternoon, so I came in on Saturday and picked up everything off the floor and gave my office a good cleaning (with 11 weeks of accumulated dust plus a coating of plaster fragments for every aftershock it really needed it!), so I’m now sitting happily at my own computer at my own desk in my own office and actually able to get on with some work. Life is good :-)\n\nThe walls are still full of cracks, waiting for the plasterers and painters to get round to our building (they’ve got a lot of work to do all over the campus, so it could be a few months before they reach us), but they’re not in structural walls, so who cares about the cosmetics – at least we’re back where we belong.\n\nI’ve optimistically righted all my fallen potplants and given them a good drink, but I’ll be amazed if they actually revive this time.\n\nRight, time to get back to work!\nPosted 14 June 2011\n\nStill alive\n\nAnother couple of big aftershocks yesterday – a 5.5 and a 6.0. Big enough that we evacuated our building at work after the first one (the 5.5), though there wasn’t much real damage that I could see – just the usual ceiling panels down and a bit more plaster falling off the walls. Still, it’s good to know management take these things seriously enough that they want to have an engineering check before we’re allowed back in.\n\nAfter the first one, once they announced they were closing the campus for the rest of the day (and today as well, as it turned out, so another unexpected day off), I walked home. I thought about taking the bus, but the traffic had already got so heavy with people trying to get home or to schools to pick up their kids that it was approaching gridlock, so walking seemed the faster option.\n\nI spotted some real damage on the way home: (photo http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/130611earthquake.JPG)\n\nThis block of shops has been closed since the February earthquake when its roof was damaged, but the big hole in the side is new (as you can tell by the rubble on the footpath). It’s amazing nobody got hit by it, because although that stretch of footpath was originally cordoned off, the cordons had been moved (probably by people who’d found it too inconvenient to have to cross to the other side of the road right beside a busy intersection), so I’ve often seen people walking along that bit.\n\nI got home, where H told me of his adventures (he’d just left the supermarket, and was about to get on the bus, when the bus suddenly started bouncing up and down). And then the shaking started again, and got bigger and bigger and just kept on going. We could hear things crashing down all over the house – it actually sounded worse than the September one.\n\nThankfully, once the shaking stopped (or at least settled down to a low rumble – it didn’t really properly stop all afternoon) we discovered that we’d once again somehow got away without damage. Most of the crashing sounds had come from the pile of CDs H had stacked on top of the CD player in the kitchen, which went flying across the room (we’re still finding CDs in odd places, but so far none broken). The laptop fell over, but fell on a soft surface so wasn’t damaged, and the medicine cabinet came open in the bathroom so its contents were distributed across the floor and sink, but again no breakages.\n\nSo apart from a bit more wear and tear to our nerves (we’re getting little aftershocks to the aftershocks every couple of hours, the biggest so far a 4.something), we’re ok. \nPosted 24 July 2011 \n\nBeing brave, and books in a fridge\n\nIt’s been a while since I posted, I know. As in September and February, the June 13 aftershocks hit me harder emotionally than I expected, and combined with the chaos they created at work (where we were just about to start exams, so had to very quickly put a whole load of alternative assessments in place, and then deal with a flood of aegrotat (consideration for impaired performance) applications) I just haven’t had any mental energy left for the last month or so.\n\nHowever, I’m slowly coming right again, so thought it was about time to dive back in to blogging.\n\nIn the last couple of weeks I’ve actually ventured in to town a couple of times. Not right into the CBD of course, which is still behind the cordons, but when Dad came up a few weeks ago and suggested a drive around the edge of the red zone I realised I hadn’t really been any further than Riccarton since February (partly because of a reluctance to go further from home than I could walk back from, in case there’s another big shake and I get stuck somewhere without transport, and partly just because with the CBD closed there’s really nothing to go anywhere for).\n\nThat first look at the red zone from the car was a shock – I actually felt quite ill when I saw the damage. Yes, I’d seen it all on TV over and over again, but to actually see it in person made much more of an impact. It was so depressing to hardly recognise the streets we were looking down, and to see how many building had been pulled down already, and how many more were obviously damaged beyond repair.\n\nThen a few days later Jenny invited me out to her place in Sumner for dinner. I was a bit reluctant at first, as the buses are still impossible if you want to get from one side of town to the other, but she suggested that she or her husband could come and pick me up, and then take me home again afterwards. So I went out there and had a great evening with them and a few other friends, and made it back safely without the cliffs falling on me.\n\nOn the way out, Jenny took me via Lyttelton, and that was possibly more shocking than the red zone, because there haven’t been as many pictures in the paper and on TV as of Christchurch. There hasn’t been as much damage to houses out there (because they’re mostly single-story and wooden, and there hasn’t been the liquefaction that’s plagued the eastern suburbs), but the town centre is pretty much gone. We turned into London Street (the main street), and for a moment I thought Jenny must have taken a wrong turning, because I didn’t recognise the street at all, so many buildings are gone. Eventually I spotted the supermarket at one end and the library at the other, but in between there’s more gaps than buildings. \n\nSumner itself didn’t look too bad, although there were a lot of obviously damaged buildings, and a few gaps where demolitions have already been finished, but the cliffs are completely different. We walked along the beach and looking back at the cliffs you could see they were quite noticeably further back from the beach than they used to be (the several houses teetering on the edge were a good clue, too). There’s still raw sewerage flowing into the sea in several places, so the beach was lined with signs warning people not to go in the water and avoid touching the sand.\n\nBut weirdly, it was good for me going out there. It was so good to see normal life carrying on among the damage, despite the fact the roads are still cracked and buckled (and this is after they’ve already had a lot of repair work done to them – as Jenny’s husband pointed out, you can tell by the size of the potholes that they haven’t bothered to repair how bad the ones they did repair were), and there’s still no sewerage (streets are lined with portaloos), and every house has some sort of damage (Jenny mentioned how lucky they were because they’d found a builder to take the brick cladding off their house and temporarily replace it with plywood sheeting, so their only damage in June was a few broken windows). Having a dinner party felt like such a wonderfully normal thing to be doing.\n\nSo last weekend I decided to be brave and go to the launch of the Gapfiller book exchange, even though getting there would mean I’d have to walk around the edge of the red zone cordon. \n\nI walked right up to the cordon in a few different places, and everywhere was the same – a small group of people peering through the fence, and an almost reverential hush. Even though technically we were all sightseers, the atmosphere wasn’t like sight-seeing so much as paying homage to the broken city – everyone was talking in whispers and obviously trying to be discrete about taking photos. \n\nOne of the weird things was looking into the windows businesses that had just been abandoned on February 22, and other than having broken windows boarded up, were pretty much exactly as they’d been left that day. Toppled over display stands, now covered with a thick layer of dust from the silt that’s still covering so much of the city. That really added to the feeling of walking through a ghost town.\n\n Another strange thing was the lack of graffiti. You’d think with all those blank walls where buildings had been demolished, and with so few people around, the taggers would have been out in force. But there was hardly any. \n\nResidential streets are lined with portaloos, one every two or three houses. Apparently there’s a world-wide shortage of portaloos at the moment, Christchurch is using so many of them. \n\nThere’s almost no traffic, and what cars there are are going slowly, because the roads are so bad, and because so much of the footpaths are blocked off that pedestrians are forced to walk on the road. And somehow quiet in a place you’d expect to be noisy and bustling like a city centre is so much more quiet than ordinary quiet – it was quite eerie.\n\nThe other really noticeable thing was the smell. The first odour you notice is the dust, which is everywhere. But underneath that there’s a hint of decay, of restaurants that still have food rotting in their kitchens, of rubbish uncollected for months. It’s not strong, but it’s definitely there, like being downwind from a rubbish dump.\n\nBut despite that, walking around the cordon actually made me feel better about Christchurch. Maybe it was just because it was a nice day, with the sun shining and a hint of spring in the air, but it was also because although the damage is horrendous, and so many buildings have been demolished, there’s still a lot more standing than you’d think from what you see on the news. And with so much of the demolition completed there’s a feeling that something new and exciting could spring up out of all those empty spaces.\n\nGapfiller are helping with that feeling, too. Their launch was great – I arrived a bit early, so helped them set up, filling the fridge with books. Sarah, the organiser, had a laptop set up so she could register the books coming in, and by the time I left a couple of hours later there was quite a crowd around her waiting to donate books, while others were selecting books from the fridge, sitting in the sun reading, talking books, and generally enjoying the day. It felt like being in an open-air library, and a great sense of community.\n\n(Photos: \n\nhttp://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq1.JPG\n\nhttp://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq3.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq2.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq5.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq17.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq6.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq8.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq10.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq9.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq14.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq13.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq15.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq16.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq7.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq12.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711eq11.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711gapfiller1.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711gapfiller3.JPG http://www.hamipiks.com/showPic.php/128913/240711gapfiller2.JPG)",

        "text": "February 22 – I had skipped the last routine in my Les Mills Step class and was in the changing room when it happened. 40 minutes earlier I had been telling a visiting Les Mills member from Auckland that the shocks had calmed down and that the new gym was structurally very earthquake safe.  As we were talking we were looking out of the window at construction workers on the wall of the CTV building.\nKnowing that the new gym was safe I didn’t feel too much fear when I was being shunted around the changing area. When it stopped I actually started to prepare for my shower when staff came in and told us to evacuate. I was surprised as I hadn’t comprehended at that point how bad it was. I stepped outside and the full horror hit me.\nI didn’t want to move from my position in the middle of Cashel St. I had the gym on one side and the Inland Revenue building and adjacent shops on the other and I felt safe. Neither had come down and I thought this was the best place to be. I deliberated about returning to my office on High St but didn’t want to move from my spot. I then saw the hordes of people walking towards me and knew I had to move.  I saw the girl from Auckland and we followed everyone to Latimer Square where we stayed for an hour wondering what we were supposed to do.  People seemed to be moving away, walking in different directions so we said our Goodbyes and headed to our respective homes. She even lent me $5 in case there were buses running!\nThe long walk began… the walk through destruction and liquefaction, hoping against hope that our house was OK, wanting to tell someone who knew me that I was alive so the message could be passed on, wanting to know for sure my partner had definitely been where he was supposed to have been at that time – if he was I knew he would be OK too. \n4 1/2 hours later I arrived home in Burwood and as I turned the corner I just knew that this time it wasn’t going to be OK.

        "text": "God moves in mysterious ways!\nRemember that song the Beetle’s sang “Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away”. We cannot look back to the past and relive it; we must apply the present to help for the future. This was to be a new year a new beginning and as I sat in my prayer closet just talking to the Father, (God) he spoke clearly to me in 2008 in an audible voice, and said “I want you to be a conduit for me” and when I looked up the word “Conduit” it said a pipe which allows things to pass through it.\nI pondered on this word for some days until it finally sank into my spirit. \nI realized that what God says to me must be spoken out to others to encourage and bless and admonish if necessary. I loved the fact that God and I spoke often to one another in the early hours.\n\nThen came the voice of the Lord through the gentle breeze. “…Your pain is the same as that of anyone who is called to be a prophet. \n\nThough fruitless, you are to convey my messages to the people. Because that is your call and mission. Life becomes meaningful to the extent you showed commitment to your call. It is not your responsibility to make people convert. You are called to make them aware of the revelations that I give to you.”   I felt so humble to say the least and I just cried and cried for what seemed an hour.\nIt was confirmed when a dear friend of mine emailed me some days later and said “You know what, you are a conduit”. Thank you for obeying God. The word you gave to me was spot on and I was blessed by it. \nI realized God was saying he wanted to pass on things he was saying to me to others. I was to be a modern day prophet for him. I was not to alter anything whatsoever he spoke and I had to seek him in all things. I had to say it as it was, in Spirit and in truth.\nThis I have been doing for some years now speaking about what is happening in New Zealand and around the world and giving words of knowledge when applicable. Sometimes when I prophesy over people I get a burden and cry. They call me the weeping prophet at times. I feel so humble and honoured to be chosen to do this and even today when I am in his presence I am in awe and overwhelmed.\nMRI Scan.\n\nSo some years later truly retired, we are now into 2010 and the fun is about to begin or is it? I had been helping Helen with something in the garden, and my disc in my back decided to give out. I sought help with a surgeon who suggested an MRI scan.\nIt all happened on the 4th July 2010 while waiting to have an MRI scan at Southern Cross Radiology Bealy Ave, Christchurch. I was in extreme pain after having a disc in my back collapse and all my nerves were crushed. \nAs I sat in the waiting room it got worse compressing the disc, and I could hardly walk, and had to be assisted up onto the MRI table and down again.\nThe twenty minutes I spent in that machine was agony having to sit still as I could, and with noises going clang, bang, as the machine took photos of my back. They played music through headphones I was wearing so one would feel relaxed, but it was still scary having to go into this long tunnel none the less. (A claustrophobic thing for me.)\n\nThose who had the knowledge and power to say “Off to the Hospital” had diagnosed me wrong. The Radiologist showed me the severity of my Disc collapse pointing out pictures of the damage at my request but chose to say, “You’ll be ok,” and sent me home. My loving daughter Angela helped put me into the car and drove me home.\n I had an injection from my own Doctor on Friday afternoon, but it did not alter the pain at all it just got worse by the minute. \nShe knew of my condition since I had been her patient for twenty odd years and I suppose she should have sent me off to the hospital too but did not. Within just a few hours later I was rushed to A&E dept. Christchurch Hospital for urgent surgery as I had become paralyzed from the waist down.  I was beside myself.\n The Ambulance staff carried me out from my bed late Saturday night to the Ambulance outside. \nI felt every bump in the road on the journey to the hospital. It was agony, but the ambulance men were very good at their job calming me down as much as possible. I was in a mess to say the least.\nI had to endure being there at A&E lying flat on my back Saturday night & Sunday morning right through to the operation at approximately 10 am Sunday. I was in excruciating pain watching others who were just drunk and a young girl who slit her wrists because she wasn’t getting attention fast enough. This in turn took the Dr’s away from me. I could not believe the slackness of things in the department.\nSo many people coming in (Mainly elderly) and those who even in the early hrs of the morning had been in accidents. It took my mind off things for a moment or two.\nMy wife was at my side and also my Daughters, Angela, and Sophia, which was lovely to see as they kept me calm by talking just about everything. What a blessing they were to me.\nI had an ECG, and Pic line inserted with injections going in to try and lower the pain level, which helped only slightly. They said I would have to have an x-ray because my heart was not functioning properly.\n (I had Atrial Fibrillation) showing the bottom of the heart working but not the top working as well as could be. Something to do with the narrowing of an artery in my chest. They said we might put in a stent, whatever that was?\n It skipped a beat every four beats and sent blood rushing to my head. Sometimes it made me light headed. It was strange hearing your heart beat audible it seemed so loud and caused anxiety in me.\nAfter being wheeled into the x-ray room by this young attendant, and being bumped around going through doorways (and I felt every one) they said that I had to sit up and I thought, “You got to be joking me! “ I cannot do that without assistance I told her I wasn’t able to sit up by myself. Why can’t they just slide the board under me?  It just did not make sense? These nurses seemed to be in training by my reasoning, as they weren’t professional in my books at all.\nI was made to sit up to a 90 degree angle with their assistance, and as they pushed just that little bit more I felt something in my back snap and the pain was greater than the first. \nThe young nurses had snapped two bones off my disc or spine? By their actions, and I was in extreme agony. \nI don’t think apologies were made I cannot quite remember, and I finally was wheeled into the surgery room after getting the appropriate injections. I came out of surgery and the first thing the surgeon said was Quote “It was the largest disc I have ever seen, and I removed two other bones that had broken off as well. The disc blew out of your back and hit me on the chest” Unquote. \n“Can I show this large disc to the medical school here? The surgeon said. I told him that’s fine go for it.\nI spent 5 days in ICU and then transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital for about three weeks, and then onto Ward 28 Public Hospital. I went on this wonderful bed which had all the mod cons fitted but as I was wheeled past the reception part of the ward, the nurse in charge said in a loud voice.\n “Oh! No! You can’t have that bed in here.” I hoped she was only joking, but she was not and I had to have a standard bed which seemed to be hard as nails. \nGod moves in Mysterious ways!\n\nIt was here that God spoke to me in a vision that I would be ministering to people and speaking about His Love, and that I would be an encouragement to those in similar circumstances at Burwood Spinal Unit. I was blown away when I found myself doing just that at Public Hospital.\n I had spoken to and encouraged 7 people and even gave a prophetic word to someone whom I did not know at all, but he accepted the word given with thanks and asked if he could keep it.\nHe was the top criminologist in NZ (Professor Greg Newbold) and I even named him by name (Word of knowledge) before knowing who he was.  Isn’t God good!\nThe only sad part of things was when I realized my older brother Desmond had died in that same ward just across the way and I was the last person he saw alive and after greeting him he opened his eyes and died.\n How he ended up there was a story in itself which for one reason or another I cannot go into here, but he needed not to have died at all had he been given the care needed in his circumstance by others in the Rest Home he was at. Somehow it all added to my trauma of things and often I would reflect on it. He died far too early poor fellow.\n\nEarthquakes, and things.\nFinally I was taken by ambulance to Burwood Spinal Unit where I was to be for about five months. Not in my wildest dreams did I think I would be there that long. It was here that my story starts regarding Earthquakes and things. \nThey had wheeled me into a room, just across from the nurses’ station, and before long the nurses brought someone else in so I had someone to talk to. He appeared to be a small man, (Roger by name) but then after talking to him I realized that this man they brought in had been run over by a train and it happened because he slipped on new paint on the platform as it had been raining.  He had been rushing to catch this train.\n The doors were locked on the train and he could not get on. He fell under the moving train and ended up with just one small left limb, no legs or hands, and no right limb at all. I don’t know how he survived. He did not seem to know who he was and his story was in the papers across New Zealand. “Who is this man? The story read. No one seemed to know much about him at all.\nMy roommate Roger was a hive of information. Talk about an encyclopaedia! He knew it all, I mean I would talk about Johnny Cash and out would come everything about his marriage, his background, what he sang and so forth. Yet he said he did not read much and occasionally he went to the library.\nI was born and bred with music in my bones since the age of five, but I only knew half of this man’s knowledge of things.\nI felt sorry for old Roger who was so likable and wondered how he would fear down the track, but the staff seemed to have a handle on things. I spoke to the head nurse Anna who came to help me and said to her, “He must be the worst case here in this ward, and to my surprise she said “No! You are”. I was astounded.\nI couldn’t believe what I was hearing anyway as time went by the nurses changed me as I had lost Bladder and Bowel control which had to be attended to daily three or four times & injections every four hrs for infections that had taken place. (Chest, Bladder, Stomach, and I felt feverish and was shaking and had pneumonia. I was in a bad way.\n\nI didn’t know in the thick of things I would experience a Quake as large as 7.1 Magnitude, and when it struck, my bed moved sideways a foot here and there with tremendous force, and as I could only see the ceiling I watched in horror as it all moved back and forth. I hung onto the rails of the bed and wondered where to now? \nThere was nothing I could do at all but lay there, and I just yelled to my roommate, “Are you Ok! He replied in a quiver, “Yeah I think so.” He wasn’t with it. I told him to Trust God!\n It was all I could do. I thought I was going to be thrown onto the floor. It was terrifying.  I felt the whole place was going to crash down around my ears. It was a deafening noise with the ceiling creaking and groaning and making ungodly noises. I guess fear and anxiety kicked in quite a bit but I tried to stay strong for Rogers’s sake as he seemed quite shaken having no arms and legs at all.\nThe nurses came scurrying in and asked if we were ok! and after assurances they left, but before they left I said in an anxious voice, “How are we going to get out of here? They replied, “Through the sliding door,” we will take you onto the grass outside. \nSure I thought to myself, and if the door was jammed or something they would’t fit us all into the hallway as there were far too many patients, but they were lovely and efficient and calmed us down one by one. \nNo- body knew of the trauma, the anguish and anxiety I felt over the months following, the hopelessness I felt not being able to walk or do normal things. The loss of bladder and bowel was as upsetting for me as staff had to do these things for me and I had to get over the embarrassment of it all. I had been such an active person getting about and helping others less fortunate than me. I really felt like a useless old sod.\nI got so angry at God first, telling him that I had done all these marvellous things for him and had showed his love to so many, why did he allow this to happen to me? Then I fought the shock and trauma etc., until finally succumbing to acceptance of how I was to be. I had to forget things and get on with life, and so I kicked the negative out and got into a positive mode.\nThe aftershocks were terrible, and added to the fear and anxiety I was feeling. All I could do was stare at the ceiling hoping another quake wasn’t going to come. I hid this fear inside away from my visitors and wife.\n\n Every time I went to physiotherapy or elsewhere I was very sensitive about these quakes and kept wondering when the next would come. I felt every shudder or vibration in my wheel chair or bed.\n\nI had to go through so much with humiliation in the days following after soiling myself and wetting the bed because I had no control over my body (Bladder and Bowel.) particularly. The aftershocks certainly did not help and I felt terrified by them.\n I would wake up in the early hours with pyjama’s soaking wet from stress and have to have them changed by the late night nurses who were much older than the day time ones.\nThe nurses were great but some stayed in their little squares they built for themselves so to speak while others moved out of the square and really helped. These ones were a blessing to me.\n It’s easy to read about pain and help people with pain, but to experience it yourself is a different story. You have to walk in the patient’s shoes for an hour or two. But they mean well.\nMaria, the Clinical nurse specialist was of extreme help to me. She often gave me sound advice on things and boy she knew how to council people with pain and things. I made a great recovery because of her input. She was so nice to talk with about things and mature. It was so sad to hear about the death in her family I felt her grieving. \n\nI knew them all by name and it was a pleasure talking to them as they came every few hours to check and change things like the bed and my pj’s.\n They helped in my recovery so much with early Rehab, Physio, and things like that. There was Tessa, she was a blessing, so much energy always smiling and willing to do anything for you, Lena was much like Tessa and helped a lot, and Kate, Jess, Kathy, Kelly, Christine, Angela, Anna, Paul, and Nathan the manager to name a few. All good nurses.\n\n(Raj) B. Singhal, the head Doctor of the unit was absolutely marvelous as well and understanding. He knew my limitations and was positive in speaking to me, which in turn made me that way too! Dr A. Anthony was as well and was exceptional in his field of knowledge of the bladder.\nThen there was Rosie the receptionist who always spoke with politeness, and helped with anything I asked for, she made me feel welcome. The Physio girls were great too especially the one from the UK, who went by the name of Kelly Robinson.\n\nJoke:\n Kelly pushed me pass my limit and got me on my feet much quicker. I used to tell her Irish jokes like this one. “This Irish man went to town sightseeing, and while looking around the city he found he needed to go to the toilet. \nHe couldn’t seem to find one and lo and behold came across this large church and said to himself “There has to be one in there! \nHe swung open the doors and as he looked down the aisle, there at the end he saw these two boxes. \nHe did not know that they were confessional boxes and that the priest was in one waiting for someone to come for confession.\nHe dashed inside the left one and heard this person next-door going “Ahem” (The priest was trying to get his attention.) Again he heard “Ahem”, but in a louder volume. Finally the priest banged on the wall to get this guy’s attention, and the Irishman said back, “Hey it’s no good banging on my wall; I’ve got no paper in here either. Ha! Ha!\n\nI achieved so much in the Gym that they presented me with a certificate. I had to climb six steps to get it from Kelly. I was so pleased I had achieved so much with their help. Annie the head girl was tremendous too, so helpful.(But I’m getting ahead of myself).\n\nI thought I was handling things quite well with progressing a little here and there. The shock was when the Head surgeon had said,                               “You will never walk again”.\n I don’t know if the quake was worse or what he said about walking.  It hit me hard and I withdrew into myself. The aftershocks never let up and made me nervous.\nAs a Christian of some forty odd years, (51 actually), I rebuked those words the Surgeon said, and set about doing what I could in the gym and exercising when I could. Whatever they asked me to do I did twice as much.\nI would pray every night “Father make me whole again let your healing anointing flow over me and heal my body. Let restoration come. \n\nI never let up day and night praying pestering the Lord. As each day came and went, changes came and out of the blue while watching a game of the All Blacks with my son in law Rick, my toes began to wiggle on my right foot. The game became second as Joy and Exhilaration took place. I was over the moon and as the weeks and months ticked by my prayers changed from asking to thanking him.\n\n“Father, Thank you for the Restoration and Healings upon my body.” Thank you for hearing my cries, and for answering my prayers. I Love you.\nI met one of the Crusaders Nasi Manu, and his manager who gave me a signed poster, and even spoke with John Key the prime minister who visited the Hospital. When John came over to my bed I made sure I said about the elderly, that they needed a pay rise. I hope he took me seriously. He seemed nice to talk with and sincere.\nSomewhere down the track, and after much Physio and hard work in Rehab I thought I was now ready to get out onto the road and go home, but I still had to endure the last month in a place called TR (Traditional Rehab).\n It was here that they put you through your paces and taught you everything you needed to know about life as a disabled person. Travis and Fiona were just great people who spent time helping us.\n They gave good advice about pacing ourselves with positive thoughts about do’s and don’ts.\nWe learnt things like cooking, and cleaning, and washing dishes, preparing meals for others once a week.\n (I had to cook for seven people and I seemed to cope ok!)  And even hanging clothes on the line.\nI even tried playing pool with two nurses behind me in case I fell, and fall I did at one time luckily not causing any damage as I had no feeling in one of my legs. It was so easy to break a leg. They taught us how to pace ourselves which was good stuff.\nIt made me laugh when I could not move and after some time the nurse Kelly (the one from UK,) came over and said to me “Lawry you’re standing on your foot”. I could have been embarrassed but I wasn’t.\n\nYet they did not put you down for your mistakes but lovingly looked after you. Today I always laugh about that episode.  \nWhile learning how to walk in the Gym with a walking frame this ball was in my way and I tried kicking it away but I used my wrong foot and almost fell. Thank goodness my instructor Kelly who was always with me saw the event, and was there to steady me. \nI guess I got over confident at times. I was like that always doing double what they said. Another time while doing exercises on my back I kept looking at the ceiling, and I spotted the loose boards above me, and saw cracks but was assured by Kelly that they were fixed and ok.\n\nOnce a week we went out to get groceries with one of the staff always at our side in case we stumbled or got into difficulty. I could not get up the gentle slope going into the shop, and finally with effort made it. Travis was ahead of me and did not see me still outside trying to get up the slope I’m sure he would have helped me had he known. \nTravis and I played pool often in my spare time, and we challenged each other with moves. Most of the time he won but occasionally I did too!  Go Travis! He was a good guy to talk to and had some good positive things to say, always on the go helping here and there. I admire him. I eventually was able to play mini golf in my wheelchair as a final rehab thing, and to my surprise got two holes in one and won a pass to come again free. I was elated and had a good day out with Kelly and staff.\n I was so chuffed as I also got a silver cup for the best in Archery at Burwood Spinal Unit, and believe it or not I split an arrow down the middle just outside of the Centre goal. \nThey called me Robin Hood and Graham took a photo of it and pasted it on the achievement wall in TR. Ward. Graham Tapper was so good and spent his time preparing the bails and getting equipment out, like Bows & arrows & guns and targets for us to use. Good on you mate! On taking time out to help us recover. You are the best. You  never thought of yourself.\nI got to the place where things had settled down a lot and asked my wife to bring in my guitar and so from that day on I would sit in my wheelchair playing and singing songs often. Sometimes I would write a new song. \nA nurse came in one day and helped by playing her Ukulele and she was good too at it. She belonged to a group that played everywhere. She gave me a list of the old songs they played and it helped me to sing more to other patients and I ended up playing for two hours instead of one.\nThe nurse’s station was just across from me and they would open their door to listen and people would come and go as their curiosity got the better of them and they would come to see who was singing.\nIt came as a great surprise to me one day as I was going to the gym for rehab, I was whistling as I went always a happy chappie, and this Maori chap (Teoti.) asked me as I passed his office if I would write a Waiata for the ministry there at Burwood which I accepted with honour.    \n\nI often tinkered with his guitar as it was much better than mine to use as I only had my old one at the TR unit.\nWe got together in the days following and he wrote words on the blackboard like “Encouragement, Love, Joy, and strength, etcetera. \n\nI sat playing his guitar quietly in his office as he was writing things on his computer and out of the blue I said write this down Teoti.\n I had the ability to create songs very quickly and to write music down within just minutes and this happened to be one of those moments.\n\nHe changed the page on his computer and wrote what I sang, the words were just flooding my mind so fast, I did not want to lose it so Teoti punched out the words. \nIt was amazing how this all happened and I knew the Lord was in it right from the start so as I strummed and started to sing Teoti started writing the song down on his computer and here is the result which took about an hour to write and finish.\nHe seemed to be so rapt with it that he rang someone from another office who came and sat down while I was playing and he harmonized with me as I sang. His name was James if I remember correctly an orderly and he sang really well. We made a great team and the harmony was really great. We ended up singing the whole Waiata through from top to bottom. Thanks James.\n“It’s a Brand new Day”\n\nV1.  \n\nSickness comes without warning, but help is on the way\n\nHealing comes in the morning, Oh! It’s a brand new day\n\n 1st   Chorus.\n\nTake courage my friend, tomorrow will come\n\nAll your fear and your worry, the battles will be won.\n\nV2    \n\nLove is part of the healing, so take it when it comes\n\nWe got to be supportive for the healing to be done\n\n2nd   Chorus.\n\nSo take my hand, and lead me on\n\nThe days will be brighter, as we carry on.\n\nV3.\n\nNo need for worry, no need for fear\n\nAll we need is courage, and knowing God is there. \nI wrote this on the 17th September 2010. And as quickly as he put the words down on paper I would have more verses. I think it ended up with about 6 verses and three choruses.\nI was so pleased with myself that I had been able to help someone and in the days following I created a time where I played in the lounge for those interested, and sang all sorts of Country and Western songs , and songs of encouragement for those listening. \nIt was healing for my soul too as I played and Roger (My room-mate) had come down in his special chair along with all my family and friends. \n\nMany people including nurses would come and go as they listened for a while when they could and as they disappeared others took their place. \nSome would just come up to me and say Thank you. It was a good time and I felt it worthwhile that I was being used as an instrument to help others in similar circumstances. It took my mind off those pesky earthquakes and tremors.\nThere was a time too! when I went to Chapel and again it was like the vision I got earlier, it had come true about ministering to people and the chaplain asked me if I would minister to the people in the chapel which I did to encourage them. They were lovely sincere people.\n There were two ladies who helped the chaplain. They were precious and so sincere. One played the organ and the other gave out song books, and helped people to sing while sitting next to them.\nThe chaplain Winston asked me to minister the following week with singing as well. I put together a couple of my own songs, and sang them and after I finished I noticed a few people had tears rolling down their faces. The anointing of God really fell and it was wonderful to see that, and if I can change someone’s life for the better then I’ve done the job God asked me to do.\nThe  Driving Test.\n\nI pestered the nurse to allow me to try a test for driving in my little Red car, (The Red Baron), and eventually was given an all Ok! The nurse in charge put me on this machine to test my reactions and I passed the test to drive my car as my right leg was getting better, and stronger as each day went by even though my left one still needed work on it. My car was automatic.\n I passed my driving test at Burwood Hospital by driving around Christchurch streets and busy intersections, and with two instructors.   I passed my final test with flying colours. It was so good to get out and about at last free of lying in bed all day paralyzed.\n“Whoopee! I was so excited to say the least. I finally was released to go home with my new wheelchair and into my own bed, Ah! Heavenly and so soft and warm. It is now November 2010.\nDisaster  Day.\n\nThey sent me a letter a few months later to say I had to come into the hospital for rehabilitation in the pool swimming etc.\nThe day was the 22nd of February 2011, and I pulled into the hospital ground beside the chapel. The time was almost 1:50 pm or there about.\n I got out of the car and put my wheelchair onto the ground as I was trained by Burwood staff to do when all of a sudden it struck. A massive 6.3 Quake. \nThe ground lifted up in front of me in a dozen places and I got thrown into the back of my car rocking to and fro. What a nightmare people running everywhere and nurses coming and checking if all was Ok! \n\nA gas bottle had broken its coupling and was thrown onto the ground not far from my car. I was fortunate it did not hit me.\nA lady came out screaming she had fallen inside and hit her head which was bleeding. Dr’s and nurses came running out and it made me laugh as the Dr’s checked their flash cars for any damage. \nI had to sit for 15 minutes or so to calm down. I thought “How can I get out,” the road had lifted quite a lot. Was my little car able to get through over the humps and damage? I didn’t want to fall into any holes, as I knew quakes could open the ground wide. My thoughts went to the pictures I saw of the big quake back in the 1930’s with ground opening up, and cars down the large holes swallowed up.\nI finally went out onto the road to go back home which was a journey of two hrs. In hind sight I wished I had stayed longer at the hospital.\n\nThings were crazy.\nWe were bumper to bumper all the way with water, liquefaction almost a metre high particularly by Kate Shepard nursing home, and at times I’M sure my little car lifted off the road, and I thought I am going to end up into the river.\n This turkey had come from the other direction and was driving so fast he made a big wave. \nWhen it hit my little car it lifted me up off the road. I was virtually floating and it was a funny feeling to me.\nIt was terrifying for me as I could not walk and thought I might drown or something. One lady had gone down a hole and had to be towed out by a 4×4 truck.\nWhat could I do the water I was going through had made me think I needed to go to the toilet (mind over matter thing!) and I ended up being in pain as I held on. No good going out in the water I could not walk to the back of the car for my emergency bag which had my catheter in it. \nThank God I finally got home. A quarter of an hour’s ride there, and two hours getting back home. Lines of cars on both sides of the road bumper to bumper and as we travelled we could see the damage the quake did. Fences down, chimneys too and kids trying to walk home as the bus would not go any further down Wainoni street.\n All the time I was thinking, “How is my wife? Is she Ok? I hope she’s not hurt. My mind was awhirl with thought after thought because of the quakes. She felt them like a 6.2  at home even though they were only a 3.9 on the Richter scale. \nOur house certainly swayed back and forth. I applaud Helen my wife who must have gone through hell while I was in hospital, she was so brave. God bless you Helen.\nWhat a mess and a half our home was in, stuff everywhere, my office had everything on the floor, clothes in the bedroom on the floor, bathroom a mess, cabinets broken, and all our antiques broken that I had kept for so long. GONE!  Telly on the floor no good anymore and just bought it a few months earlier. There was nothing you could do about it but clean up and carry on, at least we had each other and that was important as we gave each other hope and strength. We just supported each other as best as possible.\nHelen was my main stay as I held onto her while adjusting with my walking and doing things around the house. I really couldn’t get through things without her help, and love, and the compassion she held for me made me feel safe.\nAnd so the journey ends and I thank God we are Alive!\nWhat man said couldn’t be done, “God made possible.\nI think back on the journey I made and know without a shadow of a doubt that I wouldn’t be here today without the everlasting arms of the Saviour about me daily. \n The strength he gave to me to endure the hard times I faced and the fears I had that could have crippled me but He made it possible for me to get through it all.\n I held onto the scripture in the bible that says “I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.” (Philippians 4v13.)\nMy thoughts were in positive mode all the time as I knew full well to  talk negative only brought on a bout of depression and other stuff.\n\nI remember that little battery advert on telly that said, when the road gets tough, the tough get going. ( Or something like that.)\nTHE BED IS EMPTY    >>>>>>>>>>>     I HAVE RISEN:\n\nI Can Walk…………Hallelujah!.......What a Miracle!\n\n“Praise God”.\n\nToday, although not free completely of Trauma and Stress, and a little anxiety from time to time, I can say without fear, but with integrity, and with a positive statement that “I can walk.” \nYes, I can walk, I put aside the green super walker they gave me and walk unaided for short bursts, and as each day goes by I get stronger and stronger.” \nIn all things, I do use common sense, and at all times I pace myself being careful not to overdo things. (Something Travis and Fiona taught me in TR at Burwood Hospital.)\nThe picture above says it all. It’s like Jesus had his arms around me all the time. I can hear his voice say, “I told you I would never leave you nor forsake you”.\nI look back to all the get well cards some 30 odd, and the people who visited me and gave support, the coloured pictures from my grandkids, the signed large poster of all the Crusaders, and even Pat  from Elim Cathedral of Hope Church, who not only looked after my wife with food and things but made visits to the ward to see me. Bless you Pat. My sister Jean rung often to check on me, and sent a beautiful card with poems inside. Thanks Jean it was great and I appreciated it so much.\n\nBoth my daughter Angela, and Sophia were outstanding in giving support and love to their Mother and me. Also my son in laws who supported me too. Graham my brother came when I called him to cut my hair and he made a good job. Thanks Bro.\n I particularly want to mention my special friends Don and Sue who gave so much of their time to come and sit by my side and just chat. Harry and Margaret were great also bringing me tapes to listen to and good books to read. I treasured these. Thank you guys so much. \nThere is a new Pastor at Elim Pastor Nu from Samoa but born and bred in Wellington, NZ. A great family man with a hunger for the things of God.    I say a “Nu man on the block”.  Ha! Ha!\n Without the prayers of loved ones, and my endurance to succeed I would not have made it. My special thanks to all who have been part of my recovery and especially Helen my wife.\n What an outstanding person! My number one fan, so faithful in coming up every day even though she was going through her own pain, and I know the cost she endured as she did come. The earthquakes did not help one bit but she endured them just to see me.\nHelen made my day, and I forgot things like the pain I was feeling each day as I battled to get strong. She lifted my spirit up to which I am eternally grateful. Bless her heart. \nI look back on all the events that took place and remember so much that so many people did.  Thanks guys.\nSome I cannot remember their names but know the face as if it was yesterday, especially Jack from Physio who at the very beginning of things after coming out of ICU, tried getting me mobile. \n He was like in your face all the time but he did well and certainly made a difference as he freed up my muscles while I was in hospital and was an encourager to me.\nI cannot believe that already two years to the day have passed by. It is now July 2012.\n Thank you Lord for intervening when you did,                     \n\n                    “You are Awesome”.    \n\nAnd so this part of my journey has ended and I am now at home putting together the pieces which the earthquake have caused, and trying to live a normal life again.\n\nThe question is, “Can one ever live a normal life again with aftershocks coming and going every day?\n\nThey tell me we have had over 11,000 of the blighters. Wow!\n\nAND STILL THEY COME!!!\nSaturday, 3rd March 2012.\n\nToday the 8th January, 2013 with sadness I had the pleasure of being part of a group in having a send-off Graham Tapper who had passed away after having an aneurism. He was an exceptional person with many credits to his name, and the funeral was so big that many people had to stand or sit outside during the service. This man gave me encouragement and hope, and brought me out of my bed in the spinal unit to interact with others playing sport and the like.\nWhat made me righteously angry was the fact that this man had devoted his life to helping those with spinal injuries after experiencing SCI (Spinal Cord injury) himself in earlier life and was bound to his wheelchair for some 28 years. Though the hall was full of people, there were little of those in wheelchairs inside. Most were sent out the back of the church where they were told to go, some 20 odd in the shade and cold wind, a few in the hot sun with a few outside the front door. \n\nIt was hard to hear the service and one could not see who was speaking but could only guess. I spoke to another wheelchair bound person and said “This is not right”. He said Quote “We get used to it”. Unquote. I didn’t think this sort of thing happens in New Zealand.\n\nThe first two rows were completely taking up by those who held some degree of sorts. Where were the wheelchair people? \nWas it a case of Pride and thoughts like “We are more worthy & not crippled! So we will grab a seat or “Were they those In wheelchairs, being treated as “second class citizens” of no worth?  I hope not!! This was what Graham Tapper was all about. Surely they should have had a place of honour inside after the family members arrived first, and before the ordinary folk arrived.\nI wanted so much to say something about this great man and how he had helped me so much with encouraging words and hope, but I wasn’t able to get inside for the crowd. Most people I did not know.\nI did not tell Graham I was a junior champion in Archery from way back until much later, and then I helped others to achieve better results by teaching them how to hold the bow properly and stand, and things like that. Maybe I can take over where he left off?\nGraham always made sure we got tickets to the Crusaders and All Black games. He was on top of those things and always had us in mind concerning that. It will be hard to replace him. \nR.I.P. young fellow, now free of pain and suffering, enjoy a good game of golf up there.  God bless you Graham. I will miss you sorely.\nHere’s a bit of Wisdom to ponder on:\n\nThere is a lot from here that will definitely help you along your journey. Be wise and learn from it. I have resourced much further on that is invaluable.\nAt some point, most people with chronic pain are told to “Learn to live with it”. Sound pain management techniques can help you to learn how.\nPain management focuses on lessening the sense of suffering experienced by a person with chronic pain. \nIt blends Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, and social skills that help the individual regain control of his or her life and enhance the quality and pleasure of that life.\n1. We need the support of others who have experienced and understand our pain.\n\n2. Recognising emotions helps us to understand ourselves.\n\n3. While our pain is not always in our heads, attitudes and expectations do make a difference.\n\n4. Learning how to relax is essential. It helps prevent tension and redirects our attention on the things we have some control over.\n\n5. Staying active, within realistic limits, can help us remain flexible and strong and reduce our sense of suffering.\n\n6. It is important to set realistic goals and chart our progress toward them. Pace yourself.\n\n7. Chronic pain not only involves the person with pain but the family as well. Encourage one another.\n\n8. Hearing others talk of similar feelings and experiences caused by pain reduces our isolation.\n\n8. Listen, there are No Wrong feelings.\n\n10. Half the battle is won when you begin to Help yourself. Did you hear what I said, “Half the Battle is won when you begin to Help yourself”.\nYou do have the same basic rights you grant to others:\n\nYou have the Right to:\n\n1.Act in a way that promotes dignity and self-Respect.\n\n2.Be treated with respect.\n\n3.Make mistakes.\n\n4.Do less than you are humanly capable of doing.\n\n5.Change your mind.\n\n6.Ask for what you want.\n\n7.Take time to slow down and think before you act.\n\n8.Ask for information.\n\n9.Feel good about yourself.\n\n10. Disagree.\n\n11. Not have to explain everything you do and think.\n\n12. Say “No” and not feel guilty.\n\n13. Ask why!\n\n14. Be listened to and taken seriously when expressing your feelings.\n\nRead and re-read these rights so that you not only know them by heart, but so that they become part of your daily life. \n Before we get into the Discovery Helps here is a little Joke or two, to make you laugh.\nI went to the cemetery yesterday to lay some flowers on a grave. As I was standing there I noticed 4 grave diggers walking about with a coffin. 3 hours later, and they’re still walking about with this coffin. I thought to myself, “They’ve lost the Plot!\nOk! One More.\n\nI was driving this morning when I saw an AA van parked up. The driver was sobbing uncontrollably and looked very miserable. I thought to myself——that guys heading for a breakdown!\nDiscovery Helps.\n\n(The Letter “P”.)\n\nBurwood Spinal Unit prides itself on the fact that it has very good nurses, highly qualified, and Dr’s (Raj & Dr Anthony) who have your interest at heart. (I heartily agree with the statement.) \nThen there are Clinical nurses like Maria,( Clinical nurse specialist) a great person to talk with, and psychologists like Tom, & Gabriel who sings like an angel, and has a compassionate heart, who all know their jobs well too, not forgetting the urologists, and physiotherapy depts.\n\nHaving gone through the system here, after spending 5 months in the spinal unit and ICU with a collapsed disc that caused all my nerves to be crushed and left me paralysed from the waist down, gives me  the right to talk about pain issues and remedies. I hope you find an answer in all these following pages on the letter “P”.\n Very briefly, I lay on my back for many months not being able to move without assistance. \nI went through trauma, anger, bed sores, pneumonia, embarrassment from wetting and soiling the bed, I had no bladder or Bowel function, depression, and blaming God for my condition until finally coming to the last stage, acceptance. Acceptance of the fact that I was what I was, “paralysed”. I went through four infections at once, bladder, chest, stomach, with pneumonia, and a very high fever. My wife thought I wasn’t going to make it. They were pumping an antibiotic into my pic line every four hours. I was really feeling the worst for wear. I just couldn’t do anything about it and lay there uncomfortable throughout.\n\nI didn’t deserve to be the way I was. It was a Medical Misadventure.  To fight the system was sheer hell, ACC do not want to know about it! They said it was old age that caused it. Yeah Right! What a laugh! Ever been there?  \nBut touching on positive things.\nUnderstanding where you are at, and what must be done to achieve the very best results must lie with these letter p’s and other statements. \n\nSome of these are simple statements, and are not in order so just take them as they come. If you are a SCI person (Spinal cord injury) or experience pain at some level, then these steps will help you to achieve good health.\nPush on, Press into.\n\n1.    Perseverance.\n\n Learn it. Sometimes things can become boring, tedious and difficult to say the least. Try and Persevere with the problem at hand. Trust me it will get better. Your stay here will be short lived or you may be here a bit longer depending on your attitude to the problems you will face. Persevere and have tolerance. You will get through.\n2.   Patience.\n\n I was a patient here for 5 months, so now you are a patient with the same/similar symptoms I had, so be patient with yourself. You will find that not all things will work out for you at first, and you might experience pain from time to time. Chill out with yourself. Go with the flow. It doesn’t last forever. Many people lack patience, they become impatient with themselves. Have patience, In just a few days’ time things will look brighter. If you need to talk about things to someone, ask for Tom (he’s a good counsellor.) or talk to your nurse in charge or Maria, (Clinical nurse specialist), they know the score well.\n3.  Pain Levels.\n\nSome experience much pain while others don’t. There are different types of pain i.e.  Nerve pain, Urological pain, Neuropathic Pain = Nerve, Phantom pain, You might experience a burning pain, aching, dull, constant, splitting, a periodic or fluctuating pains, some get Pins and needles while others get nothing. \n\nYou do not have to put up with it so ask for pain relief from the nurses, they are there to help and know your case history. They will give them to you but only if allowed by your Dr in charge of you.  (Oxynorm is a good one, also Gabapentin, Tramadol, Fentanyl, and Oxycontin, if used for pain as a break through.) \nSomeone who was experiencing much pain said to me once, that they thought about their Lord and the pain he went through on the cross. It was excruciating to say the least, and as they focused on that they found that their own pain was nothing to complain about. \n\nTap into what you find best for you in your circumstance.\nWhen exercising too you will experience pain from time to time. Try and push past the pain barrier you are feeling as you will be surprised at the results, and the next time you exercise it will be easier.  I’ve learnt to not focus on my pain in order to get on and enjoy life. Don’t complain about your pain, it only brings it into the forefront of your mind.\n\n DON’T LOOK AT THE PAIN——LOOK AT YOUR PROGRESS.\n 4.  Think Positively.\n\nI was reading a medical journal the other day and it said quote, “When you think and do things with a positive attitude, endorphins are released in your body which cause a healing to come about. Being negative gives the opposite effect and can actually cause you to be unwell a lot longer”. Unquote”. I find this statement to be true.\n\nMany people have a negative approach to life. In the good book there is a passage that reads “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”. (Philippians 4:13)  We all need Hope, Strength and a little Faith, and need to hold onto something, if you feel you get it from reading the good book, then go for it. \nWe can’t allow ourselves to go into a spin over our predicament, and if reading positive statements from a book or two then it is worth the effort. We must practice being thankful from where we are at. \n5.  Pause.\n\nThis one could go with Pacing yourself. I believe if we just stop and think before we do something then things will work out better. Pause and ask yourself, \n“Can I do that? —- What will be the consequences?—-Will it harm me?   \n\nWhat effect will it have on me if I do it? —— Ask the Nurse if in doubt. Don’t risk it.\n\nSometimes doing things we shouldn’t do can cause further discomfort and we don’t want to go down that road. It can cause our stay here to be longer than necessary, so pause and think about the situation before you attempt it.\n6.  Be Persistent.\n\nWhen doing any exercise be persistent in doing it. Don’t try one day and then miss two. Keep at it, that way it will benefit you in the long run.\n Even while lying in bed do gentle Exercises, but don’t overdo it. Remember Just a few minutes a day keeps the blues away.\n7.  Be Proud.\n\nBe proud of where you’re at. Look at how far you’ve come. Remind yourself daily that you have advanced from where you were.  It hasn’t been easy at times but you’re made it. Give yourself a pat on the back, you have earned it.\n 8.  Pace yourself. \n\nPace yourself when doing jobs, like the garden, painting, cleaning house, hanging out clothes and you will do these jobs after you leave here. They will train you in TR. (Traditional Rehab.) for a month before you go out into the big world. Travis and the staff will watch over you and help.\n Don’t go at it like a bull in a china shop. Take it easy. There is another day! Rome wasn’t built in a day! Do twenty minutes or so, have a rest then tackle some more.\n9.  Pride.\n\nTake an interest in yourself. Smarten yourself up. If you dress badly, you might allow others to see you as someone who doesn’t care and that could be a negative thing. I know at times it will be difficult to put on clothes or even socks. I had a terrible time learning this, it took me a number of days learning which way is best, but if you keep at it, it will happen and you will become good at it. Occupational therapy will help you in this area. They are good at their job and professional at what they do.\n10.  Physio.\n\n When the nurses want you to do something to help you or the physiotherapy department ask you if you want to come down for a work out, then press into their programme. Sometimes we don’t feel like it but believe me, the more you can do things the quicker you will get better. You will see a change as the days go by.\n11. Peace.\n\nBe at peace with yourself and others. Altercations can and will happen from time to time from frustrations, and can cause stress, which in turn makes for a bad day at the office. \nYou won’t agree with everything the nurses tell you but they do know best where you’re at, and have you in the highest regard & respect concerning your health. They read your notes often to keep up with your progress. \nPain levels can rise quite rapidly through stress. I know because I’ve been there. \nI had a heck of a time after being told “You will never walk again’ and I had to look to someone bigger than me for my peace of mind.\n12.  Practice.\n\nPractice the entire above daily if possible, otherwise at least once a week. Try encouraging others as you get better. Give a big thank-you to the Tea Lady too, it makes her day.\n\nThese things helped me a lot while here at Burwood Spinal Unit, and I know they will help you too!\n13.  Platform.\n\nThis is a raised area where either first, second, or third placing’s stand after winning a race, and of course we Strive to be first, and so we should, but we only get there by pushing through as much as possible. The finish line is where the Prize is. Second or third is not an option.\n\nLast but not Least.\n14.press.\n\nForgetting those things that are behind…..Press towards the goal. You do want to get better don’t you?  Lying in bed isn’t pleasant and sometimes we get sore and our pain level can rise accordingly, but we must press on if we are to get better.\n15.Path:\n\nWe all have a path to go down, whether it is in the secular\n\n world or on the spiritual path. It is our choice to do either one or both. On walking down the path we have chosen, it needs a lot of thought and demands, and decisions must be made often to succeed in life. Being happy with where we are at makes it easier to become well within ourselves and walk down the path we have chosen. \nDon’t dwell the negative things that will tend to pull you down but think about the positive things like, if I push through and practice the things they tell me, I will be out and home in three months. (Depending on your injury.)\n16.  Pray.\n\nI know it is hard sometimes for people to do things especially when all that separates us is a thin curtain, but if problems seem to surround you a lot like they did to me, why not in your own little space pray about things. It certainly won’t hurt you and who knows something good may just happen. Think about it as thousands of people in troubles far worse than you stop and pray. I thought I was a goner, but when all else failed I prayed and from that I was able to walk.\n17.  Privacy.\n\nWe all need privacy, time to reflect on things that have happened to us, and a time to unwind ourselves whether it is with tears or something else. It is good to let go (in a positive way.)  you are who you are, not a he-man or woman but a human being who feels pain and the trauma it brings.\nNot all of these Helpful Tips will apply to everyone. Hopefully some will take aboard what has been said and benefit from them. Some will have Spinal problems like I have had while others will not have Spinal cord injury at all.\n Every one of you are at a different level of discomfit and disability, and you cannot be the same as Mary or Joe, you have to map your own plans out for the best recovery sometimes. Do Not Give Up.\n\nLearn from what you hear and read in a positive way. I guarantee if you apply even some of these Helpful Tips you will gain distance between your pain level and recovery.\n\nSo remember,\n\nDON’T LOOK AT THE PAIN—LOOK AT YOUR PROGRESS.\nLawry.\n\nlbwhms@xtra.co.nz (If you need to write to me).\n\nHere is a little extra to think about.\n“Why Muscles Get Stiff and Sore”.\n\nThe problem of uncompromising joints and muscles is similar to the difficulty of opening and closing a gate because of a seldom used and rusty hinge that’s become balky.\n  Therefore, if people don’t on a regular basis move their muscles and joints through their entire ranges of motion, they lose some of their potential. That’s why when these people will attempt to move a joint after an extended period of inactivity, they experience pain, and that deters additional use.\nWhat occurs next is that the muscles become shortened with protracted neglect and brings about muscle spasm and cramps that can become bothersome and exceedingly painful. The immobilising of muscles, as researchers have exhibited with research laboratory animals, brings about biochemical changes in the tissue.\n\nNotwithstanding, additional factors set off painful muscles. Here are some of them.\n1.Excessive exercise. \n\nHave you always believed in the saying, No pain…No gain? If you do, then, it is not so surprising if you’ve already felt sensitive muscles.\n\nThe trouble with most people is that they exercise too much believing that it’s the quickest and the most certain way to lose weight. Till they ache, they tend to disregard their muscles and connective tissue, even though they’re what quite literally holds the body together.\n\nAging and inactiveness—\nConnective tissue holds muscle to bone tendons, binds bone to bone by ligaments, and covers and unites muscles with sheaths called fasciae.\nWith old age, the tendons, ligaments, and fasciae become less extensile. The tendons, with their thickly bundled fibres, are the most difficult to stretch. The easiest are the fasciae. But if they are not stretched to improve joint mobility, the fasciae shorten, placing undue pressure on the nerve pathway in the muscle fasciae.\n\n A lot of aches and pains are the consequences of nerve impulses travelling along these pressured nerve pathways.\n2.Immobility-\n\nSensitive muscles or muscle pain can be agonising, owing to the body’s reaction to a cramp or ache. In this reaction, called the splinting reflex, the body automatically immobilises a sore muscle by causing it to contract. Therefore, a sore muscle can set off vicious circle painfulness.\nFirstly, an idle muscle tender from physical exercise or being held in a strange position. The body then reacts with the splinting, shortening the connective tissue around the muscle. This causes further pain, and in time the whole area is hurting.\nOne of the most common sites for this problem is the lower back pain. A muscle that is over worked or used in an unusual position gets fatigued and results in painful muscles.\nTherefore, it’s exceedingly important to know the limitations and capability of the muscles in order to avert sore muscles. This goes to show that there is no truth in the saying, No pain— no gain. What counts most is on how people stay fit by exercising on a regular basis at a normal range but on a fixed routine. \nSome good tips from Mike Brown who has been through the mill like me.

Rowbotham, MD and Annika Malmberg, PhD. \nPain after Spinal Cord Injury.\nWhat is Pain?\n\nPain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. In general, people can experience acute and chronic pain. Most people experience acute pain when they have a disease or injury to the body.\n It usually begins suddenly and acts as a danger signal telling you that something is wrong and that you need help. This acute pain can be severe or mild, but it usually goes away as the body heals. Chronic pain is like acute pain in that it can start suddenly. However, chronic pain differs because it can build up over time and continue long after the body heals\nPain after Spinal Cord Injury\n\nAcute pain is common after a spinal cord injury (SCI). The pain may occur as a result of the damage to the spinal cord, or it may occur from damage to other areas of the body at the time of injury.\n\nIt is also common for many individuals with SCI to experie\n\nnce chronic pain. It can occur in areas where there is normal sensation, and it can occur in parts of the body where there is little or no feeling after injury. The pain is very real and may have a great impact on daily living.\n\n A person in pain has difficulty carrying out daily activities. If you have pain, you can take 3 steps to help improve your overall quality of life.\n1 – Do not ignore the fact that you have pain! There are options for you to help manage the pain. Plus, pain can be a sign that there is a serious problem. \n2 – Talk to a doctor! It is important to first find the cause of the pain and the type of pain. Once your pain has been diagnosed, you and your doctor can decide how to best manage your pain. \n3 – Learn to manage your pain! Your goal is to reduce your pain as much as possible. The more you know about how you can help yourself, the better your overall quality of life.\n\nResearch on Pain.\nResearch on pain following spinal cord injury is very complicated. Not only are there several types of pain, but people can also describe the same type of pain in different ways. Plus, individuals with SCI can feel pain in areas where there is no damage to the body. You may have severe pain at times and little or no pain at other times.\n It may change if the weather changes, if you smoke, if you are tired or emotionally upset, or if you have problems with your bowel, bladder or skin. These are only some of the factors that make it very difficult for doctors and researchers to diagnose, classify and treat pain.\nResearch has shown that your level of injury and how you were injured can have an impact on whether you have pain. Individuals with low levels of injury tend to have more pain than those with higher levels of injury. Individuals who are injured by gunshot have more pain than persons with SCI caused by other factors.\nGroups of Pain.\n\nIndividuals with SCI can experience several types of pain. The most common can be classified into three groups.\nNeuropathic Pain.\n\nThe types of pain found in this group are common for individuals with SCI. After all, neuropathic pain is caused by damage or dysfunction in the nervous system, which includes the spinal cord. It can generally be described as a sharp, shooting, or burning pain, but the pain is often described in other terms as well.\nSpinal cord central pain,\n\n is a type of pain that can begin within weeks or months after your injury. You feel this type of pain at or below your level of injury in areas where you have lost some or all of your sensation to touch.\n It is thought that the pain signals are coming from somewhere other than where you feel the pain. However, central pain is not related to what you do or how you are positioned.  Additional terms used to describe central pain include tingling, numbness or throbbing.\nSegmental pain,\n\nOften occurs around the border where you have normal sensation and loss of feeling as a result of injury. It can be slightly above your level of injury or slightly below. It usually develops during the first few months after injury. Segmental pain is often associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia in the painful region. \nAllodynia is pain caused by something that does not normally cause pain. For example, something cold, warm or a very light touch to the skin can result in pain. Hyperalgesia means an extremely painful response to what is normally only mildly painful.\nNerve root entrapment pain.\n\nOften begins days to weeks after injury and may worsen over time.  It occurs at or just below the level of injury and has a distinct pattern. You may feel brief waves of stabbing or sharp pain or a band of burning pain at the point where your normal feeling stops. You may find that light touch makes the pain worse. \nThe pain stems from compression of a nerve root by a bone or disk. Pain from damage to the cauda equine (the lower part of the spinal column) is a type of nerve root pain that is described as a burning feeling in the legs, feet, pelvis, genitals, and rectum.\nSyringomyelia is a hollow, fluid filled cavity (syrinx) in the spinal cord. It is not common, but sometimes develops months or years after injury. \n\nThe cavity can slowly increase in size and extend up or down the spinal cord. As the syrinx expands, it can result in pain along with an increased loss of sensory and motor function.\nMusculoskeletal\n\nThis type of pain is also a concern for individuals with spinal cord injury. It occurs in parts of the body like the bones, joints, and muscles. Musculoskeletal pain is usually worsened by movement and eased with rest. It can generally be described as a dull or aching pain, but the pain can also be described in other terms.\nSecondary overuse (pressure syndromes)\n\nIt is a very common cause of musculoskeletal pain. The pain can occur months or many years after injury. It is caused by the overuse of muscles in any part of the body. For example, many people develop tendonitis of the rotator cuff (shoulder) as a result of pushing a manual wheelchair for a long period of time.\nMuscle spasm pain.\n\nIs experienced by some individuals after SCI. The spasms are involuntary movements of the body in areas that have lost some or all motor function. The pain is caused when muscles and joints are strained.\nMechanical instability of the spine is caused by damaged ligaments or fracture of bones. It occurs most often shortly after injury, but it can also develop later. The pain is usually around the area of instability.\n\nVisceral.\nVisceral pain usually begins a short time following SCI. It occurs in the abdomen (stomach area) either above or below the level of injury. The pain is described as burning, cramping and constant.\nPain Management:\n\nPain management usually includes treatment with medications, modified activities or a combination of both. It may not be possible to completely stop the pain, but an effective pain management program can lessen the intensity of the pain.\nPain management can be a very difficult process. Many times it is hard to know what is causing the pain in individuals with SCI. You should talk with a doctor who knows about pain after SCI before you try any medications or methods of managing pain. It can take time to work out how to best manage your pain. An effective pain management program depends on the type of pain you have.\nSpinal cord injury pain.\n\n Is the most difficult to treat. Some neuropathic pain-relieving medications such as Neurontin (gabapentin), nortriptyline, and amitriptyline may work in easing the pain. In other cases, a pump can be implanted under the skin to deliver opiates and clonidine to help relieve the pain.\nSegmental pain.\n\nMay also be eased with neuropathic pain-relieving medications. Other treatments that may also be effective include spinal cord stimulation and epidural blocks along with surgical procedures such as dorsal root entry zone lesions and dorsal rhizotomy.\nNerve root entrapment pain.\n\nStems from vertebral instability. It might be relieved by stabilization, by opiates or by neuropathic pain-relieving medications. If there is bone or disk material present, decompression surgery is usually done to relieve the pain. Treatment to the peripheral nerves is usually needed to relieve pain from damage to the cauda equina.\nSyringomyelia \n\nIt is diagnosed by a MR scan and requires surgery to remove the syrinx.\nSecondary overuse.\n\nIs often managed by modifying activities that use the joint or body part that is in pain. This may include limiting or stopping activities that make the pain worse. \nFor example, it may help to limit pushing a wheelchair if you have shoulder pain. It may be necessary to switch from a manual to a power wheelchair. \nRelieving Pain without Medicine:\n\nMore helpful hints.\n\nFor some people, pain can be relieved without using medicine. They use relaxation, imagery, distraction, and skin stimulation. You may need the help of health professionals to learn to do these for yourself.\n\nFriends and family members can help with some of them. The techniques are also useful along with pain medicines. Information about non drug treatments for pain also may be available at a local hospital or pain clinic.\nRelaxation relieves pain or keeps it from getting worse by reducing tension in the muscles. It can help you fall asleep, give you more energy, make you less tired, reduce your anxiety, and make other pain relief methods work better. Some people, for instance, find that taking a pain medicine or using a cold or hot pack works faster and better when they relax at the same time.\n\nRelaxation Techniques:\n\n•Understand that your ability to relax may vary from time to time and that relaxation cannot be forced.\n\n•Remember that it may take up to 2 weeks of practise to feel the first results of relaxation.\n\n•Try several relaxation methods until you find one that works for you.\n\n•Stick with the same method so that it becomes easy and routine for you. Use it regularly for at least 5 to 10 minutes twice a day.\n\n•Check for tension throughout the day by noticing tightness in each part of your body from head to foot. Relax any tense muscles. You may use a quick technique such as inhale/tense, exhale/relax.\n\nIf you have any lung problems, check with your doctor before using any relaxation technique that requires deep breathing. \n\n•Relaxation may be done sitting up or lying down. Choose a quiet place whenever possible. Close your eyes. Do not cross your arms and legs because that may cut off circulation and cause numbness or tingling. If you are lying down put a small pillow under your neck and under your knees or use a low stool to support your legs.\nI hope this helps you as it has helped me in getting better with my SCI.\nAbove all learn to pace yourself.\n\nTen or twenty minutes then take a break.\nJack———-ICU Physiotherapist:\n\nJack was the first guy I encountered in ICU Public Hospital. He was the Physiotherapist there. He helped me tremendously in trying to get my legs moving in the very early stages of my Paraplegia. He would say things like, “Try and walk to the window! And of course I couldn’t, but he was there standing beside me in case I fell. Another time he would try and see how long I could stand for, and that was only four seconds before crashing back on the bed.\nI often would try and walk along the corridor on this huge walking frame that took my weight, and it kept me upright.   I would transfer over to the rail, and holding onto the rails just sliding my feet sideways. \nJack was persistent, “come on back again once more” he would say, but he was very understanding as he had encountered back problems himself in early life.\n He was gentle but firm and so patient with me. As time went on I wrote this poem about him. I called it Sergeant Jack and here it is on the next three pages.\nSergeant Jack.\n\n4th July, 2010.\nMy name is Jack, I had a sore back, and now it’s Lawry’s turn\n\nTo see this patient happy, relieve the pains that burn.\nI know the pains I went through, and surely he must too,\n\nWhen I saw him on that first day, I thought what will I do?\nHe seemed so cold and angry, I’ve known the feeling well,\n\nMy job is “keep them moving”, my head it does not swell.\nSo out with the walker, off for a stroll, let’s see what Lawry can do,\n\nHis hands they are so nimble, I’m sure he will get through.\nYeah! My name is Jack, and now I’m back, to set a goal for him,\n\nI’ll walk him 30 metres, together we will win.\nNow Jack is back, he’s now got the knack, I think he’s after me,\n\nHe knows I can’t run quickly, not even for a pee!\nHis heart is in the right place, because passion he does show,\n\nBut I wish my bladder would work, so I can darn well go!\nOld Jacks on the go, don’t worry about that, he bounces through the door,\n\nI’m sure he has an agenda, to give poor Lawry more.\n\nBut nevertheless, I’m sure Jack means well, \n\nas lessons do go on, it’s only time that will tell.\nSo goodbye Jack, thanks for the ride, \n\nit’s nice to know, you’re on my side,\n\nGod bless my friend, and many adieu, \n\nYou’ve done a good job, good luck to you.\n“Moral of the Story:”\n\nThey say “Don’t mess with Sergeant Jack,\n\nHe’s quite a tall big dude,\n\nYou don’t want him to slip just once, or make a great big boob.\n\nYeah! Sergeant Jack “I’ll be back “Vista LA vista Baby”\nThis will be one of my last entries in this book.\n\nToday is the 14th December 2012 and it seems like a life time since I had my accident, and by Medical misadventure I became a paraplegic after my disc in the 3-4 region prolapsed and all my nerves were crushed. It all happened on the 4th July 2010, two years, five months and ten days to the date. \nMy body is in an ongoing healing process. After being healed from my complete paralyses, by an unseen hand that I knew was God Almighty, and whom I pestered night and day for a healing in my body and for restoration.\n I feel ecstatic that I can walk and do things again (to a limit) that I thought I would never do, like driving my car. \nFrom time to time I do get tired if I walk too far, but to do this unaided without my sticks or walking frame I count a blessing from above. Occasionally I use my wheelchair if the distance is too far, but the fact is “I can Walk again”. “Praise God”.\nCommon sense has prevailed along the way and I have done what I have asked others to do, and that is to “Pace myself”, and be patient with whatever state I am in thinking positive thoughts as much as possible, and to look back and be proud in how far I have come. \n\nI could not have done this without the help of friends, Dr’s, nurses, family and of course my precious wife Helen who day after day persevered with me and my problems I faced. Helen is a wonder what with her own trials CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome) to whom the experts, Dr’s, Professor’s, Pain Management, and the like, have no answer to the problem which is worldwide. A hidden medical condition.\n They do suggest this and that and think it will work, and they are always telling her to do this or try that but the result has always been zilch. They make her go to meetings and do exercises that they think will help but they don’t know what Helen is going through because they have never been in her shoes. All they know is what they read in hand me down books, and thesis papers.\nYear after year she has had to have medication some stronger than others just to get through the day, and at any given time she could have an onslaught of pain, yet she hides it with great care. She is a marvel and day after day she goes through this helping me with love and compassion.\nBeing paraplegic is not a happy place to be in sometimes and of course there are problems one face and must deal with each day, and in my case that is Bowel and Bladder problems, but even those are slowly coming back and being restored little by little. God’s hand is still at work.\nEach one of us are at a different place in life and with our disabilities, some worse than others. I do believe however that being positive in life has been a plus for me. Also I have learnt to persevere in all circumstances and push through when I am able to, as much as possible.\nOn reflection, it is sad to see that most of my friends who came so faithfully to see me when I was paralyzed have disappeared. They were like angels in the night, but it is sad that I see little of them now. Even my own family do not come as much either. They gave me encouragement and made me feel better within myself.\n\nNevertheless one makes new friends along the way. The old seems to disappear and a new life begins to spring forth.\nI have looked at a lot of paraplegic, male and female people in wheelchairs, and they have been such an inspiration to me as they do things unbelievably, so much more so than most that are able bodied. These ones are the champions, ones who battle on regardless like those who suffered from Cave Creek. We have such a one at our new church “Grace”.\nI feel so much of a fraud (it seems that way) when I play pool, and here I am standing, bent over the table hitting pool balls while they are in their w/chairs. It seems unfair and sometimes I miss on purpose to give them a break, but these guys are expert at playing and really leave me behind so it forces me to play better.\nBut I suppose I have been an encouragement to them as they have to me. It is good not to dwell on the past but look to the future and deal with the present as it presents itself each day with a positive outlook.\n\nI look back at the events that passed through my life and think of the hard times where I had to endure, but also the good times and through it all I am delighted that I am where I am today and as the song says,\n\n“I get by with a little help from my friends”.\nWhoever reads this book of mine whether a family member or just someone passing.\nBe blessed in all you do and above all be careful on the roads. Have an awesome Christmas and New Year. \n\nGod Bless you mightily.\nYesteryear……...  Testimonies.\n\n Some years ago I was standing at the stove cutting tomatoes into a fry pan.  Helen’s father was watching me and talking to me from the table about 10 feet away when suddenly the blade of the knife went through the tomato so quickly and I felt its fury cut through my finger. Blood seemed to be everywhere and all I said was “Praise God” so I went to the tap to wash the blood away and there was nothing there\n\n I mean absolutely nothing. God is so good.  I know I felt it cut my finger as Helen’s father went Oh! When it happened and so did I as I jumped back from the pan.\nThe other day being 3rd January 2013, I was improving on the feed tube for the budgie so he could eat more seed, making a V shape in the tube  when the hacksaw slipped off the tube and cut deep into my thumb. It was a new hacksaw with a new blade, and it was sharp.\n\n Again I have learnt to give thanks in all things and only said good words and believe it or not after washing my thumb there was hardly anything to see, I mean no blood but a very small scratch. I have to give the Lord the praise and the glory for it all as on both occasions I know damage was done but God got there quicker than a plaster.\n\nOne other time when I was in my teenage years and my friend and I had been able to get a flagon of beer from the pub and we were on our way home from there with the booze tucked inside my jacket. I was riding on his motor bike as a pillion passenger going down Colombo street, and I could see the car in front looming up very fast.\nI said to him watch the car in front but it was too late and we hit it at force making a V shape in the boot of it. I flew over him hitting the car and landing in the gutter with the flagon of beer intact and not a scratch on me while he lay on the middle of the road with a bone sticking out of his leg and in pain.  \nA long time ago when I was a foreman supervisor at Atlas making fridges and freezers I came in early one Friday to replenish the chemicals which made the foam inside the appliance doors and sides. One of my workers came over and between us we rolled a forty-four gallon drum along the rollers to put the drum into a cradle at the end.\nIt made a very tight fit once the drum was in place, but somehow the ineffable happened. My foot slipped on the roller and as I reached out for balance my hand went into the cradle just as the drum did squashing my thumb completely. \nMy worker grabbed the edge of the drum with his fingertips and with all of his might lifted it enough for me to slide my hand out. Again I said  “Thank you Lord” as I wiggled my thumb and hand and found it to be completely alright. The factory nurse came over and confirmed it so but for my other worker he had to be off for quite a number of days with swelling in the tips of his fingers. I firmly believe that if you keep positive in all you do things work out for good.\n”We don’t have to swear when things go wrong”. It says in the good book to praise God in all things.\nThere is always something you remember when it’s all done and dusted, and here is one of those things.\nAN AFFAIR WITH CTV\n\nA NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE:\n\nIs there life after Death?\n\n(My brother’s ordeal.)\n\nThese were my thoughts as I watched and heard the cries of many in the collapse of CTV. I thought for a moment I was going to die.\n\n CTV.\nWe all have our story to tell about 22 February 2011 and on asking my brother about his ordeal, here is what he said.\nMy brother Graham, who is one year older than I, was on his way with his partner Diane, who had been a cleaner at Canterbury television Building some five years earlier. She was completely deaf and they were on their way to a meeting at the deaf community building which was in or near the CTV building, and as he was approaching the building he let a car out that was backing onto the road and decided to park further on down the road. Normally he parked in the car park there but this day 22 February 2011, for reasons known only to him alone he decided to travel on past the building.\nHe knew quite a few of the people there as he had helped her clean at times, and he also had been on the “Happy Hour “ singing at the TV station.\nSome of those people were Noel who hosted the show and played piano for him. It was there that he met “Shopping with jo” a wonderful lady who was well received by staff and public. Matty Beaumont a technician and presenter yet another staff member he befriended. And many more.\nThis is His Story in his Words.\n\nMy partner Diane worked at the CTV building 2 hours a night and on occasions I would help her, so I got to know the layout of the building and its people.\nOn that terrible frightening day of the earthquake that struck Christchurch violently and without mercy, we were travelling to an appointment with the deaf association in Armagh street, as Diane was completely deaf, and on nearing the CTV building along Barbados  and Cashel street corner I stopped to let a car out that was parked outside the main entrance of the CTV building and instead of going into the car park which we normally would do, we decided to park on the road side directly opposite the entrance of CTV.\n It was just a footpath away when the Earthquake struck without warning and with vengeance.  I saw the car in front of me rise in the air quite some feet and skew over to my left and within seconds of watching that event there was an almighty bang and red dust and dirt covered my RVR car.\nPieces of rubble started to fall on the road from Blackwell’s Motors to the right side of my RVR.\nI pulled on my hand brake and stopped as the ground was shaking violently and the car was rocking sideways as well as and up and down. I had never experienced anything like it in my life. The noise was tremendous and the sounds coming from the building site were terrifying as I heard yelling, and high pitched screams coming forth. \n\nI will never forget those screams. It only took a few seconds and the whole building was gone and as the dust cleared I could see the structure of the stairwells and lifts. The noise of the rumbling of the quake and the ripping apart of the road in front of me was tremendous. The road had lifted my RVR up like it was a match stick. My heart was beating at a tremendous pace and I thought I might pass out or something.\nThere was a moment of anxiety and of terror as I wrestled with the fact that I could have been killed had I gone into the car park. Was it God who saved me? as I did believe in Him or was it just a moment of quick decision to go past that day.\nWhatever the reason I was eternally grateful that I went past. “I thought the whole sky had fallen down around me”. Earlier on Diane had tried to get out the car but I pulled her back. When the building came down it engulfed the whole car with thick red dust.\n I tried desperately to see out the window and had to use the wipers which were virtually useless. The dust was too thick. At last I got a small hole made in the thick dust and was able then the drive the RVR over the rocks and damaged road.\n As I looked across at the CTV building I saw it was no more just a heap of rubble and twisted steel. It was awful trying to dodge the cracks in the road that the earthquake left. \nI will never forget that last scream or seeing the building down and the power and devastation that caused so many beautiful lives to be lost. I finally got around the corner and parked by Latimer square for what seemed a very long time, just getting my sanity back and feeling the heart beats getting slower and slower.\nHad we pulled into the car park as we had permission to do we would have died under the rubble as we always parked in front of the emergency stairs that were on each floor. If it had collapsed even sideways we would have gone too by the falling masonry.\n We are thankful that God saved us, and always will remember this ordeal and the great Christchurch quake as long as we live. I have never been back to the area where it all happened nor the fallen city of Christchurch.  \n\nGraham/Diane.\nConquer Fear\n\nHere’s something to think about as a last thought.\n\n “The Seven Truths” that can help anyone harness and overcome their fears.  I’ve paraphrased them for you here:\n\nThe greatest is this one. “Wisdom is to fear God”.\n\nTRUTH #1\n\nFear is the dominant challenge in your life today.\n\nTRUTH #2\n\nFear is a “gift” that was instilled in you as a means of protection, and a way to bring you closer to God.\n\nTRUTH #3\n\nWhen you run from, or deny your fear, you leave that “gift” unopened.\n\nTRUTH #4\n\nWhen your fear of success, or fear of failure is exposed, you break through the control they have over you.\n\nTRUTH #5\n\nYour belief system is the driving force behind your behaviours and your results.\n\nTRUTH #6\n\nYour everyday habits broadcast your belief system, your fears, and your unmet needs, loud and clear, for others to “pick up.”\nTRUTH #7\n\nChange your beliefs (the way you think) and you change your behaviours (which are a reflection of the way you feel).  Change your behaviours (feelings) and you change your results. Change your results and you change your life.  It’s the only way you can…\n\n…and that’s worth thinking about, isn’t it.\n\nBlessings Lawry——-Bye!\n\nDefinitely the last page:\nAnniversary Day:\n\n22nd February 2013:\n\nWell today is the day it all happened, two years to the day, the day I was thrown into the back of my car while gas bottles were being hurled at me from a distance having been ripped from their moorings.\nThe story so far:\n\nI was supposed to be having rehabilitation in the swimming pool but as I pulled up to the disabled park by the Chapel at Burwood Hospital it happened. \nThe time was exactly 12:49 pm in the afternoon and I had wobbled from the front of the car to get my wheelchair from the back. I lifted the boot door and swung my chair out onto the pavement and was about to put my seat cushion onto the chair when this terrific noise happened and within seconds and without any warning I was thrown \n\nInto the back of my car boot being belted about by this massive earthquake of 6.3 magnitude, the time was now 12:51pm. I thought it was world war three as pieces of objects were shooting across at me.\n\nOne lady was screaming and holding her head. She had come from inside the hospital and obviously had been thrown to the ground for her head was bleeding.\nDr’s and nurses came running out of the building to check on me and others on their way to TR where other patients were. The ground had opened up in front of me under the force of the quake and all I could see was these gaping long gaps in the tarmac at intervals of 5 metres apart.\nI wondered if I was going to be able to leave the grounds of Burwood Hospital, or whether my little Dingo car would fall into the holes as they appeared large gaps.\nI finally ventured out onto the road thankful I could get out of the hospital grounds but really not knowing what I was in store for later.\n\nThe journey was terrifying as water and liquefaction had seeped onto the roads making them dangerous. I couldn’t get over one bridge as it was damaged too much and had to travel further on down to Wainoni Road on the eastern side of the city where I encountered very long lines of cars bumper to bumper. We were all travelling in about a metre of water and if you stopped which we did often then you had to stay in your vehicle or get soaking wet. \nOne lady tried taking a short cut but ended up in a large hole swallowing her car. She was towed out by a 4×4 truck and was lucky she did not drown.\nKate Sheppard, the old people’s retirement village was completely had it with water surrounding the whole place as well. \nWhat a mess as I travelled to get home not knowing how my wife was. I saw fences that had been bowled over, children having to brave the walk on foot to get home and houses on slants and broken from the force of the quake.\nFinally I arrived home after a gruelling two hour stint being terrified at what I might find at my end. Sure enough as I pulled up by the garage and made my way into the house I saw it. \nAll my office stuff was thrown about as if a pack of kiddies had been loose in there. There was stuff all over the floor and as I opened the wardrobe the lot came down on me.\nThe rest of the house was the same with Helen’s antiques all broken and my new telly down on the floor broken too. The kitchen plates and things had crashed down on Helen my wife, causing her to get cut and the lino was cut and marked by the fall.\nWhat a nightmare the bathroom was in. There was stuff all over the floor and cupboards thrown onto my commode chair smashed and ruined beyond repair. After coming home, travelling in all the water I was in agony waiting to use the toilet which I couldn’t so I had to make do and hold on. You know the rest……Cheers enjoy life………Lawry.",

        "text": "We weren’t that impacted by the earthquakes.  Our 100 year old single storey wooden character home flexed and moved. Apart from a few drafts, and a munted foundation, it was perfectly liveable.  Our power was on within a week, water within a month, sewerage a month or two.  We dug a toilet and worked from home.  It felt good to be part of a close knit family and community.\nFor a year or so our national news filled with stories of Christchurch.  Global generosity embraced us.  A new language was born; “assessment”, “TC3”, “geotech report”, “scope of works”.   \nBy September 2013, two years after the February quakes, our land was zoned orange, then blue green, then green, then technical category 3.  As we were “over -cap” (our repair was more than $100,000.00) we had a Claims Manager with a private insurance company, a Loss Adjuster, Project Manager and Builder.   \nFriends whose claims that were “under cap” had to deal with the government managed Earthquake Commision – EQC.  EQC had no idea what it was doing, or how it should be doing it.  We felt that we had dodged a bullet.\nOur Insurer gave us a contract and a 10 page scope of works to lift our home and replace the foundation.  As a lift often caused more damage, we were told a more detailed scope of works would be prepared once our home was lowered.  We moved out in September 2013 for an estimated 6 months.  We acted in good faith, but it soon became clear that everyone was out of their depth and no one really knew what they were doing.  We moved back in October 2017.  \nA four year repair.\nOur story is just one of thousands of claims that were mis-managed by insurance companies, poorly scoped by project managers and badly repaired by Builders.   \nPerhaps we should not be surprised.  It is very difficult to get your head around the scale of the Christchurch earthquakes.  No building was designed to be lifted and dropped 0.5m -2m repeatedly.  \n98% of residential properties were insured in Christchurch.  By 2017 there were maybe 3000-4000 homes which were uninsured and 172,000 homes that were damaged out of a total of about 200,000 homes. Insurance had a lot on their plate.\nWhen Insurance companies stand to lose billions following a major disaster, what you need to know is that everything is negotiable.  You must act in good faith, you can’t lie, but you cannot trust. \nIt is in the interests of the Insurer to reduce the cost of your claim.  Claims Managers may receive bonuses for this.  As New Zealand insurance policies have no timeframes, Insurers have a get out of jail free card and will delay and delay and delay.  It is up to you to decide how much money and time you can afford.  \nInsurers will bend the truth until it almost breaks.  Our insurer said – we will only replace exposed polished rimu floors – if its carpeted you get back chipboard.  We should have said put back the rimu, that’s what our policy covers.  Others who stood firm got what their policy stated – like with like.\nWhat you must know is that insurance is a game, a game of claims.  You must decide on your position, no matter how shaky the ground and stand firm.  \nOf course you will think it won’t happen to me.  I thought that too!  You live in the shaky isles.  Chances are, it will.",

        "text": "I was on the university campus when it happened, eating lunch with some friends. The earthquake hit, someone said “holy cow”, and we all dived under tables or doorways. This is strange, because this was actually the first time I’ve ever got under anything in the progression of big earthquakes since September 2010. It is also the first time I’ve felt in any danger, in the buildings I have happened to be in. As I sat under the doorway I could see cracks appearing in the hallways before my eyes and the whole building rumbled and creaked, five floors of concrete above us on the second storey.\nWe got out as soon as it stopped – leaving all our things behind in our offices – and assembled in one of the carparks nearby. Just a few minutes later another big one hit, and this was strange, because normally the quakes are very difficult to feel outside. This one was quite different; I felt like I was standing on water, and had to brace myself against a car, which was rocking back and forth quite violently itself. If you looked up you could see all the buildings swaying and all the people around us were, for a moment, definitely NOT your average garden-variety do-not-betray-emotion-or-fear Kiwis.\nThe scary part now was waiting to find out what was going to happen. It was impossible to have got through the last five months without learning what this kind of quake means for the buildings in the city. It was also easy to imagine the possibilities to the people of the city, especially in the middle of a busy working day. However, I had no clue it was as bad as it was. The first rumour I heard was that someone couldn’t see the spire of the cathedral from their office, as usual, and I was sceptical – remember, it’s a misty day, I said. Then I heard about buses crushed by falling buildings and that was when I started to feel that this was very very serious. The cellphone networks were very clogged, as were the roads, and I was getting text message after text message from family and friends, who obviously were not receiving my replies, so I walked home to use our landline.\nIt was so good to see my flatmates. Three of them were at home, very shaken up but okay, and the other one got home soon after me. She had almost delayed leaving town just before the earthquake, and if she had stayed she would have got on the bus that was hit by a falling building in town. No power but we had a handy transistor radio. My stereo fell off its shelf plus a bunch of books etc, but no broken glasses this time. I rang all my family in different cities, couldn’t get through to my sister in Christchurch but other relatives had been in contact. She had been unable to get in touch with her husband and her kids, who were in their daycare, and so she walked from the hospital in the CBD all the way to the hospital on the outskirts of the city where her husband works – at 23 weeks pregnant. My grandmother was fine, stoic as always – she is a trooper. My dad is out of town at the moment.\nSoon after I got home, I was talking to my sister in Dunedin on the phone, and another big aftershock hit. Lucky her, she got to listen to me getting under the table and then suddenly realising that water was pouring through our roof. Turned out our chimney had just fallen down, breaking something on its way, and our bathroom and laundry was rapidly flooding. I feel quite proud of the fact that I rushed outside with my toolbox, found the mains, and turned off the water. Girl power! This did mean, however, that now we had neither water nor power.\nWe sat listening to the radio – a form of masochism on that day – and just felt so ridiculously miserable and bleak. We would have liked to pray together (we’re Christians), but what do you say in words other than a simple “help us all”? So we got out guitars and sang some songs together and we didn’t feel much less miserable but it did feel cathartic. We all knew that eventually we would hear about friends or family of friends who were missing.\nEventually we decided to decamp to my father’s house, which is in a part of town that had water and power. We felt guilty being able to turn the lights on and run the taps and boil water easily. But like everywhere else it was impossible to sleep through the night with the earthquakes rolling in like waves, and we were all up early to sit glued to the television yet again.",

        "text": "The school kids were in the field behind the fence, lunchtime had just started. Bubs had just had her lunch and was following me around the house. I was wrestling with the vacuum lead and I noticed that our cat had disappeared from his sunspot outside. I thought nothing of it as that’s his usual response to seeing the vacuum cleaner.\n20 minutes later (with bubs in tow) I tried to kick the vacuum off with my toe and lost my balance. The vacuum turned off by itself and I thought ‘I must be really tired!!’ \nI tried to regain my balance and realised it wasn’t me that was knocking about, it was our house. I picked up bubs and got under the bedroom door which was our usual quake spot. The quake was loud and knocked things off shelves, opened cupboards, widened cracks etc. It set fear in my heart.  \nAs soon as it stopped I bolted with bubs to where our old analogue phone is stored and ran back to plug it in. I knew our power had gone out because of the vacuum cleaner and my cell was low too. Between aftershocks I rang hubby at work who was okay and was helping his injured co-workers then coming straight home. It took him almost 3 hours due to panicked traffic. I rang our families and our friends, I can’t recall all the numbers I rang while holding bubs who didn’t want to be held. I had to change her nappy twice in the doorway! \nOne of the scariest moments was hearing the squealing of brakes out on the street and the screaming and yelling of parents as they ran to collect their children from the school. At the same time, it made me feel safe because Bubs and I weren’t alone in this madness. But once they had all gone and the street was quiet again, that unnerving feeling started up.\nBy 2.45pm and hubby still hadn’t made it I did a dash around the house and gathered what we’d need, loaded up Bub’s pram and decided to get to our next-door neighbour. Her house is newer than ours and thought it’d be safer. As soon as I took one step with the pram we had a massive aftershock (5.5) which toppled the pram. I dragged Bubs and the pram back into the house and we waited in the doorway until hubby got home. Hours went by where the phone lines were down and we didn’t know how a lot of people were. \nWe decided to go next-door and were welcomed warmly. We sat around the battery powered radio listening to the one station that we could find…the other CHCH stations seemed to be out of order. Thankfully our lovely neighbour cooks with gas and we were able to eat dinner but no-one had running water, functioning loos, phone, power etc so we were definitely back to basics.\nLater that evening, when the rain started, our saviours arrived and invited us to stay the night where they had everything we did not. We charged our cells, had more hot food and for the first time, saw the chaos as everyone else did on TV. What a frightening experience. Just seeing what had occurred 10 minutes from our house almost brought us to our knees. I know that we were lucky, lucky that we were not in the CBD or East of the City. So many were not lucky.",

        "text": "22 February 2012\n\n1 Year On\n\nThe Memorial Service . . .\nThere are more road cones in Christchurch per km of road than any other city in the world, I think.  And today those road cones were all filled with flowers.  A small reminder of where we were a year ago.  \nToday is 22 February.  1 year ago today our world as Cantabrians was shaken to the core, and 185 people lost their lives.\nThe whole week I, as many people around me, have felt anxious – like there might be another big quake; sad – there has been such tremendous loss over the last year; and maybe even a bit angry – why did this happen to us?!\nThis whole week I have been feeling tremendous loss, almost like how you feel when someone dies.  And today was the “funeral”.  The memorial service was held in North Hagley Park.  Rain had been forecast, but the weather was “perfect” for an outdoor memorial service. The sun was behind clouds, it was warm, and there was a gentle breeze.  The children and I were amongst some estimated 40,000 people to attend the funeral.  \nThe service started with the National Anthem.  I can’t hear the National Anthem without crying, so I was a blubbering mess by the start of the service, but sang proudly in my tear broken voice.  Then the address from the Mayor, Bob Parker.  He is an amazing orator and spoke so extremely well.  The first biblical reading was read by a young man, Sam Johnson, who started the “Student Army”, who after 22 Feb 2011 came and dug liquifaction, and helped people in need for weeks and weeks after the quake.   Then we sang “How Great Thou Art” in Maori and English, and then the Prime Minister read a passage from the bible.\nSome lovely music was played by an orchestra, and the names of the 185 people who lost their lives were read out.  Everyone in the crowd stood in respect at this time, and it was tragic to hear how many of the people who died were foreigners.  Aussies, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Israeli’s, Russian, Philipino’s, British, Serbian, and I think 1 or two other countries.  The most of these people were in the CTV building which collapsed.  The CTV building housed a foreign language school, and thus the tremendous loss of lives of foreigners.  I felt very sad for the Japanese people who only 3 weeks later had to deal with their own earthquake and tsunami, and had lost several young people in our earthquake.  We had a Japanese search and rescue team here in Chch for about 2 weeks after the quake, only to return to Japan to start all over again.\nThe service went on with 2 minutes of silence at 12.51pm, the time of the quake.  My son commented afterwards how quickly the 2 minutes seemed to disappear, as we were all so lost in our individual thoughts.  All I could hear at the time was the sound of church bells in the distance, and the sound of the breeze in the trees, and I was reminded as awful as this year has been, I was not alone.  All of these people around me had “shared” this experience.\nThe Governor General then read a letter from Prince Charles to the people of Canterbury, and made a wonderful address himself, finished by a poem that was written about Christchurch in 1900.  I am going to endeavour to get a copy of this poem, as it was beautiful.  But he reminded us, “The Christchurch of today is not the Christchurch that the poem was written about.  Things will never be the same again for Christchurch”.    \nThere is great hope for a new Christchurch, a better Christchurch, but the fact is nothing will ever be the same again here.\nThen there was a broadcast from Hillary Clinton which was heartfelt, and unexpected.\nThe service ended with the releasing of 185 Monarch Butterflies while a choir sang “You Raise Me Up”.\nIt was a beautiful service – this “funeral” – a time to say goodbye to the past 12 months.  The last of many firsts someone described it.  We’ve had a birthday, or a Christmas, or an Easter, post quake, and this was the last of the firsts.  \nJust as we were about to leave, I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned around and there was an elderly lady in a blue dress and a white hat on.  She said to me:  “I don’t know why but I wanted to come to you and say to you if you are going through a difficult time, or have been through a difficult time, just know I care.  I just wanted you to know that.”  I put my arms around her and gave her a big hug and just said thank you.  (Hey dad up in heaven, was that you sending me that message?) This has been Canterbury for the past 12 months.  Strangers reaching out and touching each others lives in ways we would never have even considered before.  \nI looked across the park and reminded myself, when I shook, you shook.  When I was woken in the middle of the night, you were too.  When I was afraid, I was not alone.  “We are all in this together”!\nThe first anniversary of the Christchurch Earthquake is now over, and hopefully our time to move on.\nKia Kaha Christchurch – Be Strong!\n\nGod Bless, and Be Safe everyone.",

There was no where to go, my partner and I stood holding onto each other,  as the shaking got worse, the lights went off,  as the rocking continued I saw a great rush of dust go past the door… at that point I thought this is it, we are not going to make it through this.\nWe did, the shaking stopped – we ran outside into chaos.  As I was with my partner, my first thought was for my mum who lived in town – I tried to text her off my partners phone, but my hands were shaking so much, my partner and I decided to run to my mums work.  The sights on the way were astounding, roads that had ashphalt tents in them, the avon bubbling like a spa pool, buildings down, and people screaming and crying.  We got to my mums work and I remember seeing her through all the panic.  I called out and as she turned she burst into tears,   one of the saddest and yet happiest moments of my life was seeing my mum alive and well.  As we headed back to our work building we realised we had no keys on us – I ahd left my whole hadbag at work, and my partner had left his keys.  By the time we got back to work, no one was being allowed into the building.  we tried to get a life home from a friend but after sitting in traffic down for 45 minutes not moving more then a block, we decided to walk to bexley.\nThe walk home was frightening – it was like a movie.   So many people all walking int the same direction, we saw alot of amazing frightening things on our walk home, and yet witnessed amazing human compassion.  A man and woman down Avonside Drive had set up a table outside their driveway and were offering people cups of tea and coffee.  As we got closer to bexley we noticed how bad it was – our street was completely flooded.  We arrived home to a mess, my dog (my furbaby) had escaped out of the broken fence.  This was the starw that broke the camels back for me, I got hysterical.  I went out and looked for him and a good neighbour had found him and locked him in their yard.    We stayed in Bexley for 2 nights before we packed up and moved to my mums in halswell.  I remember looking at the TV for the first time when we ot over the the west and not wanting to watch it any more.  Feeling the gut wreching heart ache of people who have lost loved ones.  My heart still goes out to anyone that had to lose someone that day.\nMy family and friends were all ok.  I am so very lucky, and am blessed by what I have.  We will continue to live in CHCH for the soul of CHCH is great.  Through all of this tragedy there has been rays of light and has shown the amazing strength of people living in this City.

        "text": "I work from home so I have seen our home go through the three major earthquake events. Our house is on the beach side of the Southshore spit which lies between the sea and the estuary. The sand our home is built on has been quite stable and has had no liquefaction. \nOur weatherboard and tin roofed house has survived quite well but being near the epicenter, the violence of the shaking itself has broken concrete slabs and caused the piles of the house to move. Geotechnical reports say our house has risen a metre but we do not really feel sure what is going on.\nDuring the September event we also experienced the additional concern of tsunami. In February and June events we have been closer to the epicenter and so had a lot of things broken and much more damage. In all three events it has been hard to stay on our feet and we’ve been thrown about.\nDuring the September event our house was full as a friend’s wife had recently died and so we were hosting people on the Friday night. One guest had just flown in from the UK the night before the quake struck. At 4.30 am our family of three (two adults at and one teenager) two guests and our two dogs ended up in the car driving for high ground after being shaken violently awake.\nThe initial shaking did not cause me to feel  too much panic but as we drove and found roads to be splitting and the bridge across the estuary collapsing it became more alarming. We followed a 4 ×4 across the bridge and only just made it in our sedan with the car scraping over the gaps. Driving through town, lights were out including traffic lights. Some cars were speeding and the road was becoming more treacherous as tarseal lifted and gaps in the road grew.\nHaving established there was no tsunami threat we carefully made our way back home. There was no power or water and soon found out the sewage system was down. We were just thankful no one was hurt and got on with the business of day to day survival. Due to the funeral we had ten guests in the house for breakfast that day. We were lucky to have a gas hob we could still use for cooking and boiling water. A neighbor bought water over for us. In the following days and weeks it became clear that hygiene, water, cooking were our biggest problems. \nHaving camping gear and an inverter that ran off the car to charge cell phones were critical. Cell phone and radio became the only means of communication. We dug a long drop in the back garden. (Which we still have to use through to July this year – though we had to build a winter proofed version).\nPeople being harmed in the February event affected us all in different ways. Fortunately our immediate friends and family were not hurt but going to funerals to support friends and colleagues made the impact much more significant. The damage to the city was much more obvious. As the aftershocks continued sleep deprivation became a problem. Being close to the epicenter meant being rattled awake a few times each night and so day to day life was even more difficult. We had to take breaks away from Christchurch for short periods.\nWith the June event finally bringing down so many of the Christchurch landmarks it has been a more emotional impact in terms of how we feel about continuing to live in the city. There is the realisation we are gong to be in a construction zone for a long time. Many friends and neighbors have moved away. There are gaps in our streets, homes and lives. However we have got to know many new people and realised there is a great community of people in Christchurch. The future however does bring some fears and insecurities.  But alongside that there is great hope we can all build something good out of all of this.",

        "text": "I was sitting on the bench out in the vet clinic in Ferrymead, Having my lunch. I happened to look at the clock to see it was 12.51pm. I heard this mighty roar, the lights went out, and I was thrown across the room and landed like a starfish on the floor. All the drugs where being dumped on top of me.  I was not panicking, just thinking that this is a good aftershock from September quake, (As I was in Dunedin, and missed it) I could not get up to get out, was just being thrown to the floor. I happened to look up to the open door into the shop, and saw the whole steel fish tank stand, with all the full fish tanks, lean right forward and then back to the wall. After it stopped, I managed to grab my dog, and head outside. I was surprised to see the front of the BBQ factory had fallen down, thought it must have been bigger than what I thought.\nThe booze from the Henrys shop next door, was just flowing out from under the automatic doors, and it was High.\nWe managed to get all the animals out. And caged for their parents. I had to try and get back home to Rangiora to collect my son from school.\nI remember sitting in traffic on Linwood Ave, by the shell station, when a 5.0 aftershock hit and the canopy swung violently. A man in a Van on the otherside of the road, yelled at me, look at the canopy, if it had come down I would have worn it. It took me nearly 3 hours to do the half hour trip home. The hardest bit was trying to find a bridge to get over. I am not one for sitting in traffic, lol. So I was driving around all the side streets, and found a wee bridge to drive over, just before they closed it. I drove around the river, following a truck, thinking if he fell in a hole, I know not to go there, as the road was covered in liquafaction, and my car was lowered. But I made it. I would never leave Chch, as this is my home. As i drive over to Ferrymead these days, I find it mentally tiring, seeing all the work that needs to be done. I am impressed with all the people who have stayed and are living in those conditions, day in, day out. But the time on the clock will be burnt into my memory for as long as i will live, oh and flying through the air.",

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Christine Wilson conducted shortly after the 22 February 2011 earthquake.\nMy name is Christine Wilson, I am 52 and I was fortunate enough to be in Rarotonga when the quake happened. We found out pretty much soon after it happened, we had lots of phone messages, so it came as a big shock. Even though we didn’t experience it ourselves it still was… as soon as we heard we phoned everyone at home to make sure everyone was OK  and then we started making arrangements to come back. We only had three days left of our holiday. We phoned up the airline and they got us onto the next available flight so that was really good. \nWhen we came back home our house was pretty much like everyone else’s- we had lost a lot of contents, but the main concern for us was the roof, and that’s just been replaced recently, so we were fortunate that they replaced it pretty quick. But we have been able to stay in it from back then.  So we consider ourselves pretty lucky really.  \nAlthough we had been warned what to expect and my family had forewarned us to expect a lot of rubble and we had TV coverage in the islands, but it wasn’t the same to see it in reality. Just driving back into Lyttelton and seeing the devastation… I lived here all my live and seeing the buildings down… oh wow… pretty sad. \nBut having said that the biggest impact for me is the loss of lives. When I heard that people had lost their lives through the earthquake… I can’t really put it into words… it’s just really tragic. After we heard that we couldn’t pretend we’d have a good holiday or continue with our holiday, we had to come home.     \nWe were fortunate, because we were away and had quite a good holiday and weren’t traumatised by the earthquake. So we felt we were in a good position to start helping. So first we got the [Community House] building inspected, because we wanted to open the doors so that people could access the services. And from then I made it quite clear too that we would support anything else that people needed help with. So as a result of that in the first week I heard there were a group of teachers trying to put something together for the students and they didn’t have a place to go so I offered them the Youth Centre so that worked really well. \nThe other thing was the community meals, because they had to move out of the recreation Centre, so I was more than happy for them to use the kitchen here and it’s become an ongoing initiative now here with the meals. It’s been identified as a real need through the winter for these elderly folks. We were serving lunchtime meals every day. Before the earthquake we’d have a community lunch on a Tuesday, and about 12 to 24 people came for that.  Since the earthquake it depended really, we have workmen coming through because there was no lunch for them to buy. A lot of people that come here would come in every day, not just for food but also support and talk.  \nNow we are serving 42 meals every evening, not just to elderly people but also people that may have an illness or are vulnerable. We’ve had really good feedback from the medical centre, it helps a lot of the older folk and their health improves and it’s a good way for them to have contact of course. And we’ve got a great group of girls coming in and they are here every day to help with the meals, they are feeling they are doing something constructive, because most of them lost their jobs, which is unfortunate.   \nIt was a busy period and we had lots of agencies coming through and making sure that everything was Ok and see what they could do to support . Compared to several weeks ago it had quietened down quite a bit. \nThere are lots of positive things. I like the way that people have pulled together, neighbours get to know each other, people generally reaching out to one another. It’s enabled people to reprioritise their lives and look at what’s important and what’s not. I’ve heard a lot of people say that something was important to them before the earthquake and it doesn’t really matter now to them. That’s been good to hear.  Good comes out of disaster, it’s only the matter of finding it. It’s the people thing really- people seem to be more caring and more considerate about one another at the moment so that’s good.     \nFor me it’s been a time of reflection. Things are never going to be how they were, before the earthquake. Moving forward and looking towards the future is how we can create really … I don’t want to say a better place but… I have a good feeling going forward… if people take the lessons out of the earthquake that they’re supposed to learn, if they can keep the unity,  than maybe moving forward we are going to create something really special. Remembering what’s been because there is a lot to remember and respect and then let that be and build a foundation to move forward. And I think too looking at all the tragedy going on in the world, Canterbury has been slammed really hard twice and it’s almost like ‘Are we being prepared for something?’ So maybe we can help somewhere else down the track.   \nI think too of young people who are involved here with the Youth Centre… a lot of the things that they are used to going to aren’t quite as accessible at the moment, they are just finding grass root things to do at the moment which is really good. Yesterday was drop-in and we’ve got someone in to work with them for the next few weeks and they were trying to get ideas from the young people what they would like to see and it was more about going out and kicking a ball and learning to make something and learning to tie a tie, stuff like that, which was really interesting to hear. There was a move away from the whole computer thing, which was good. \nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton .  We are very grateful to Bettina and the interviewees for allowing their interview transcripts to be posted on QuakeStories.",

        "text": "I wrote this a week after the Sept 4th earthquake.\nThis week has been the longest, yet shortest of my life.\nA week ago I was making dinner, putting on the dishwasher, going to bed a little late so not doing the dishes because they’d still be there in the morning.  My house was clean, well the kids rooms, kitchen and lounge which is something which is rare in this house but was my new mission.  I was working out what cleaning I was going to do the next day so my house could start to look like something I could be proud of.  Little was I to know what was to come.\nSaturday 4th September, 4.35am.  Shaking, some thing’s not right, I usually stay in bed on edge when there’s an earthquake but something was different, something was not right with the sounds I was hearing.  Mark bolted and grabbed Morgan, I raced and grabbed Lauren then just stood under her door frame, something hit me, (turns out it was our fire extinguisher, I was very lucky I was hit in the shin and that neither Lauren or I was hit in the head), I was screaming in my head, the sound was something else, a wobbling banging sound, something I can’t describe and certainly hope I never hear again.  It was still, raced over to Mark and Morgan and just sat in the door frame with the two kids while Mark sorted us out light, grabbed Morgan’s duvet, it was so lovely and warm.  Mark was running around checking on things, checking on neighbours, all the time I just wanted him with us.  The power went out during the shaking so it was difficult to use phones and the like.  After a little while we moved into Laurens room as there are toys in there to keep the kids entertained, there was no way I was going back to sleep after that and wasn’t expecting the kids to either. I text Mum straight away as I didn’t want her waking and hearing the news and wondering if we were ok, I ended up ringing their home phone and waking them up, I knew they couldn’t do anything but just the thought that they knew was comforting.  I left it till a slightly more reasonable time to text my best friend and sister to let them know, again not wanting them to wake and worry.\nDay was starting to break, it was the eeriest thing, all was quiet and still, apart from the occasional aftershock.  I’d been listening to the radio through headphones as all we had was a little radio walkman and no speakers to use.  I knew that buildings were down, that roads were torn up, I was trying to be strong for the kids.  Once the sun was up enough we went for a wander around to see what had happened immediately around us, we got off very lightly.  Out came the camping gear to boil water/milk so we could have hot drinks and breakfast.  The power came on at 10.30am, in the meantime we had located our old corded phone and plugged it in to take strain off the cell network and our batteries that we didn’t know how long we’d have to rely on.  Mark’s work had called, he works on the roads so in events like this they’re called out to assist, he told them he was staying home.  We located the cat who’d been missing since the outset, he was hiding in the far corner under Morgan’s bed, this has proven to be his safe place since and we’ve found him back there a number of times.\nI don’t remember much of the first day, we got the kids to bed then went to bed ourselves at some point but didn’t really sleep, it was a long night, always on edge, always waiting for the next shake, I was so scared that when I needed to go to the toilet I made Mark come with me.\nSunday morning came and the sick feeling I’d been coping with all night came to a head, I ended up attempting to throw up but my stomach was empty so nothing would come.  Mark had to go into work for a bit, I was a complete wreck so I went to his parents place for some company.  The feeling of unease was with me the entire day and again I ate hardly anything although I did force myself to try. Night came 8.30pm and it was off to bed, slightly better sleep but still not ideal.\nMonday morning and I was calling plumbers to come sort out our hot water cylinder that thought it was a good idea to go for a bit of a walk during the earthquake, a friend came round in the afternoon, as much for support for her as for me, quick dinner then bed at 7.30.  Much better sleep, woke to a few aftershocks but I was at least able to sleep.\nCan’t even remember Tuesday to tell you anything more of it other than we went to bed at 8.30!  Oh I went to a friends for a shower and the kids had a bath, then another friend came round that afternoon.  Lauren decided that tonight was the night to be awake for 2 hours then Morgan woke distraught at not being able to find his water bottle.\nWednesday morning, Mark headed off to work, 8.51am a rumble, shaking, a massive bang, more shaking and a bit more of a rumble.  We’d just had a decent aftershock, power was off again and I immediately called Mark to let him know we were ok but had no power, he didn’t realise how strong it was but as we were to learn the reason for that is because it was so very close to home.  He was straight on the phone arranging for a replacement so he could come home, which he did and spent the rest of the day at home with us, was ideal really since the cylinder was replaced then and we went and did the groceries.  Went to bed around 9 and slept quite well, woke to an aftershock but got back to sleep quickly.\nThursday I was on my own with the kids all day although I did talk to a couple of friends on the phone and Mark popped home for a very quick visit.  Night started to fall and Mark still wasn’t home, the uneasy feeling started to creep back, as it does most evenings anyway, he finally called and we agreed to meet at KFC to pick up some dinner, was very pleased to get out and do that.  Again the night went well, no kids waking which was wonderful just an alarm for Mark to go to work.\nFriday has been mostly uneventful, my cousin popped in for 10 mins this morning en route to the airport to head back to the UK, she was in Wellington or somewhere like that at the time and was only in Christchurch last night.  The afternoon bought a visit to a Playcentre friends house which was a nice walk away, kids are very tired though so were melting down at the end.  Mark got home after dark again, kept Lauren up till he got home, not sure why but having them both up playing made me feel more comfortable.\nSo that’s my week so far, nights are the worst, I’m not sure if it’s because the earthquake hit at night or if it would be the same if it was during the day.  I’m not fond of the dark any more, wasn’t it’s biggest fan before but I’m even less so now.  Night brings on the nerves, the ill feelings and the need for adult company to feel safe.  The littlest sound makes me jump at night although I am still a little jumpy during the day.  I’m certainly not in a rush for Mark to start working nights again.  At the moment I’m taking each day as it comes, there’s really not any other way to do it, you get better but every shake or noise sends you back a little again, not completely back to the start but enough to not want to be on my own.\nThe kids are coping reasonably well, Morgan is 4.5 (well almost) and Lauren is 16.5 months.  They’re both more tired than usual so it is taking a toll on them but we’ve certainly gotten off lightly.  Morgan has a love for making loud noises and shaking things around, Lauren is just demanding and starting to throw things when things don’t go her way, I’m not sure if they would have been like this otherwise but these are new things for them.  We put a lot of it down to the fact that they didn’t wake before they were in our arms so all they were aware of was us protecting them.\nWhat made us move instantly that time when others we haven’t I will never know.  We are very lucky, we lost our hot water cylinder and have cracks in the walls that weren’t there before, but we have a house to live in and Mark still has a job to go to, we still have a family.  We have a lot to be thankful for.",

        "text": "I wrote this a couple of nights after 22 February, when I felt like I needed to get something out.\nSitting across the desk from a colleague. Discussing something trivial. A little shake. Another aftershock, nothing to worry about. A big shake. The big bookcase behind me hits the desk beside me. The building bucks. Scrambling under the desk, hands on head. The sound of the person I’m with doing the same. Nothing.  Someone tells me they could hear the fire stairs coming down one flight at a time, thump, thump, thump, thump. Next memory is of the office manager. Shouting for everyone to get out, over the screaming of the other staff. \nStanding up, everything has fallen over, and there is no clear path to get anywhere. Rather than going straight out, I go to my office, over files and bookcases, to collect my wallet, cell phone, and coat. I remember thinking ID might be important, as well as a way to contact my partner and the kids. Looking out the window, dust, and the roof of the PGC building, on the ground. Running to the stairs. Others coming back, yelling that the stairs have gone. I have to see for myself. Concrete dust and a black hole through the fire escape door. Later I saw people climbing down that void, floor to floor using fire hoses. We choose not to do the same, in case there is more concrete above ready to come down. \nBack to the office. Trapped now. Everyone on our floor is gathered in the boardroom, until someone realises that that part of the building is cantilevered over the street. We move back towards the lifts. We need to find a radio. There is one under a desk in the tenancy next door. Two of us go to retrieve it. The batteries work. We hear that the power to the CBD will be turned off. A relief, since that might reduce the chance of a fire. And that the station will shortly go off air, for lack of power. Another aftershock. Screaming and panic. Wandering through next door and not wanting to look out the window. Sure that Clarendon Tower, where I have friends working, will be gone. It’s not, but looking down to the street I see a blanket just outside piles of bricks that have collapsed into the street. There are bare feet sticking out the end, covered up the next time I look. Another body to add to those that must be in PGC. It is awful. \nWe must be low down the lost of priorities to get out, given what we can see. We’ll be here for a while. How long are the ladders the fire service has? We’re only on the sixth floor, but can they reach this high, when they come?\nBack in the office. Four or five of us talking. Me and another colleague alone. I’m afraid of fire, and the building coming down on top of us. He is too. \nNo safe way out; we are probably best to stay for now. No reason to do anything stupid. Have talked to my partner. She and the kids are fine. Tried not to sound too scared, but probably failed. I don’t want to go this way, here, crushed or burned. Want to see her and the kids. More than anything. \nWe need a way out in case we have to get out quickly. I remember seeing a program about quake survival. Cords and internet cables can make a rope. We start collecting them together. We need to break a window too. Down to the carpark is only three floors. From there, it seems like we could go on to the roof of the next building which slopes down to one floor off the ground. Being at level three, rather than six, seems better anyway. \nHow to break a window? Seems easy, but these are tough. Find a screwdriver, or a knife. Hit it with something. Some are pressing, just find a way out, find a way out. The screwdriver is in the kitchen. Its pitch black, and full of broken glass. About the worst place I’ve ever been. Find the toolkit in the end cupboard, and run. I find a metal table leg. Phillips head screws. It might work. Start working on the screws. Another aftershock. Dive under the desk I’m unscrewing. Noise and swaying. It feels like being at sea. I heard later the building was going like a pendulum. It’s not a surprise. \nNext door’s survival kit has ropes, gloves and a sledgehammer. Back to the boardroom. The plan is to break a window, and find a safe way out. Not sure how many are listening. \nBack through the building. John hits the window with the sledgehammer. It breaks and fresh air is good. No idea of time, but with no aircon we’ve probably been breathing the same air for an hour or so. A colleague leans through and talks to firemen in the carpark, or on the street. He has shards of glass hanging above him. We pull him back by the belt, and the shards are knocked off. The firemen say a ladder is coming in ten minutes. We wait five, and then push on. No ladder ever comes, although a crane arrives a few hours later. \nJohn knows how to use the ropes to get us out. He ties the knots. We will lower people down one at a time, with two ropes tied to each person.  John hands me the other rope; he is going to hold one. I haven’t done this before. One of the others has military training, and he is younger and stronger than me. He takes the rope. I sit beside him, as a backup in case he slips. One of the other guys does the same behind John. One colleague holds the ropes together at the window;  another leans out and calls distance from the ground. There are two men holding each rope. \nIt works; time to start lowering the women down. John holds one rope for everyone who goes. My colleague and I rotate holding the other rope. It hurts when the weight comes on. As one of the others is being lowered down, a big aftershock hits. Someone yells “Hold on”. They do.\nDown to five now. The firemen say help is coming. We use the twenty minutes we wait to lower down servers and computers. No help arrives, so two more of us are lowered down. I wonder if I should have stood up and asked to go. I have kids. \nThree of us left. We’ve been using four or five people to lower each person down. Choices are limited, but a crane arrives before we have to decide. We wait, and the crane platform arrives at the window. Two minutes later, we’re safely on the ground.",

        "text": "*Trapped in a collapsed building \n\nThis is the story of  86 yr old Miss Grace Heyward*\nIt was Tuesday, my shopping day with Lesley, my friend and carer. She called for me at the usual time of 11.45am and we went to a restaurant to have lunch before she took me grocery shopping. The little bakehouse and café situated in Colombo Street, Sydenham was the one we chose to go to nearly every week. We always enjoyed their food and the staff were friendly.\n\nLesley parked her car outside the café and we entered at 12.15pm. The table nearest to the kitchen where we usually sat was occupied so Lesley took our tray over to the far side against the brick wall adjoining to the next shop.   At 12.30pm we both remarked on how the café was filling up. We had not noticed it so full on other Tuesdays.\nAt 12.50pm after we had finished our lunch and chat, it was time for us to leave the café. I had just stood up. It takes me a minute to straighten up, get my balance and grab my walker. At that moment another major earthquake hit Christchurch causing many suburban areas and this very restaurant to shake so violently that the building began to fall apart.\n“Sit down, Grace,” Lesley said, grabbing my arm. “Don’t move.” \nI watched in horror as the windows smashed and the roof started falling in. Bricks, timber, iron and glass were soon a mass of rubble several feet high. People were thrown on the floor, some bleeding and severely wounded.   It was then I called out to God. “Oh God! Save us.” \nBricks fell and landed on the end of our table. I put out my hand to stop a piece of iron falling on me. A woman was lying at my feet. She could not move as her leg was caught under fallen timber. Lesley stood up from her chair  which was pushed hard against the brick wall. Broken debris fell around her. Then ceiling plaster fell on top of me. It split in two. There was a cloud of dust. I could not see Lesley or anything in front of me. I said to myself ‘this is it!’ I could see no way of escape. I was trapped.\nEventually the dust cloud lifted and I could see the heads of two men trying to clear the entrance. They saw Lesley and said, “We’ll get you out soon.”  They had not seen me or the lady lying on the floor in front of me.    All the other people had been carried out.\n“Don’t worry about me!” cried Lesley. “There’s an 86 year old here and another woman on the floor. Get them out first.”    At last!  I was being carried out by these two brave men. It was almost an hour after the earthquake. I had to leave my walker behind with all the rubble. I was put on an office chair and wheeled down to the Spotlight car park and laid on the ground with all the other wounded. I lay there for another hour.\nI suffered no injuries, but was in a state of shock. There were quite a few aftershocks while I was in the car park,  which felt as if the ground was opening up from under me.\nLesley never left my side, except for going back to see if she could get her car, as the street had been petitioned off. A security man got it for her, but was not able to go into the smashed building for my walker.    It was 3pm when Lesley and I left the car park. The distance to our home was usually a 10 minute drive. The roads were so bad it took us another hour.  After a three hour ordeal, we were at last safely home, but were not able to have a shower because  the water was off and would be for the next three or four weeks.\nI know without a doubt that God did save Lesley and I.    We were the only customers who came out with hardly a scratch. I fail to think how I would have managed without Lesley. She was a strength to me. The verses of scripture which came to me that week were:\n\n‘Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved’. Romans 10:13 and Psalm 55:16.  ‘As for me, I will call upon God and the Lord shall save me.’   How I thank God that once again He has protected me from danger and from a near death experience. This was indeed a miracle. \nThe Aftermath – Two Months Later    \n\nThere have been a number of aftershocks since the second major earthquake hit Christchurch and many suburban areas on February 22nd 2011.  Lesley took me back to look at what was ‘Tasty Tucker Restaurant’ in Colombo Street, Sydenham.  All the rubble was cleared away, including my “Walker”.  But what was of interest to us was that the glass cabinet with all the food (sandwiches, cakes, savouries etc) was still standing untouched.  The glass wasn’t even broken, so there had been no food scattered over the floor.  The wall on the left had two huge holes in exactly the same place I had sat at our table.  Lesley sat opposite.  To my knowledge, those holes were not there when we were rescued.\nA niece of mine in Westport is a member of the Salvation Army.  She wrote to me after reading an article in the War Cry, (the army newsletter,) which was written by one of the officers from Wellington about how he was caught in the Christchurch  earthquake.  This story she thought, sounded very much like Auntie Grace’s story, so she sent the magazine  for me to read.  This officer and his wife from Wellington were visiting her father in Christchurch.  They decided to have a bit of lunch before going to the airport as they were to fly back that afternoon.  They were the ones sitting at the table where we usually sat.  The officer, after he had finished his lunch, decided to leave his wife and father-in-law while he went two doors along to the Christian bookshop.  He had just walked into the shop when there was a loud rumble and the most terrifying earthquake.  He stumbled outside and saw timber and bricks falling on cars that were parked outside and then he realized that the cafe he had just left one minute before was the heap of rubble.  His first thought was to rescue his wife and her father, not knowing whether they were badly injured or even dead.  After climbing over everything, he managed to get them to safety.  Fortunately, they were not to badly hurt except being covered in dust and dirt.  Then this brave man didn’t stop there.  He went back in along with another local man and brought all the wounded out.  One died instantly and two more later.  I was pushed along to the car park on an office chair.  This officer also went to the car park where he talked and prayed for all of us who were lying on the ground with a towel under our head’s and a blanket over our bodies.  One lady was seriously injured.  I learnt later that a beam came down on her.  As a result she is now in the spinal unit at Burwood  Hospital.   I lay next to her in the car park.  My heart ached for her.  Her mother had been on the floor at my feet with a painful shoulder and cut on her head. I felt the need to contact the daughter after finding out her name.  I wrote to her in a card.  Her mother rang me.  I hope and pray that one day I will get to meet them.  I will also be contacting that officer.\nI was in a state of shock for a few weeks.  When there was an aftershock, I would jump, shake and call out.  My nerves were on the edge, but I recovered and am well.  I thank and praise God every day that he saved Lesley and me and brought us through this traumatic experience.  This is all a true record of what happened on that unforgettable day.",

        "text": "In 1987, I was working for AMP as an insurance and superannuation sales person. I was based in the building now known as Ernst & Young, but then was known as Avon View. When work began on the building diagonally opposite our building (144 Kilmore St, now Dept of Labour etc), we had to endure weeks of the pounding of concrete piles being driven into the soil. After a while, I bumped into one of the engineers from that worksite, who told me that the area was a major problem for liquifaction, and that the piles were being driven to ensure that the new building was not a quake risk. He then went on to assure me that the building I was in was not a risk, as he knew it was well-built. He then nodded to the building beside mine and said, “be glad you are not in that piece of sh*t, it is rubbish that was built with no knowledge of the sub-strata.” The building he referred to was later known as the PGC building. When I heard it had collapsed in the earthquake, I remembered that 1987 conversation with startling clarity. And cried.\nI, like others had got on with my life, never giving that building another thought. But now I think about it regularly.

        "text": "Tuesday, 22nd of February: 2 of our grandchildren, Fran, aged 6 and Igor, aged 12, were staying with us. On Tuesday morning we went with the children into the middle of Christchurch. I dropped my husband and Igor off at Science Alive, and parked the car at the Farmer’s car park. Then I walked with Fran around the center of town: we went to the Art Gallery, the library and spent quite some time on Cathedral Square, looking at the children’s gardens created in connection with the Ellerslie  Flower Show, displayed just outside of the Cathedral.\nWe left again at 12.40 and drove to the Science Alive building to meet with my husband and Igor.  We parked behind Science Alive and walked across to the Mc Donald restaurant on Moorhouse Ave. We were standing at the counter to order, when the earthquake hit. The lights went out, people screamed, food and machinery started to fly. We were thrown around, bashed against the walls, little Franny fell, but we somehow managed to stumble outside. We were all incredibly shaken, but the strangest thing was that, as we were cowering on the grass strip outside, the traffic lights turned green and all the cars drove on, as if nothing had happened. A few young blokes ran back inside the restaurant to get the food they had left behind.\nWe went straight away back to the car. As we clambered in the car the next aftershock happened and all the parked cars around us started to hop up and down and bounce around the parking lot, which would have been amazing had it not been so frightening. \nWe drove in the direction of our son’s school. The roads were flooded, mud volcanoes spewed silt everywhere, walls had peeled back, people were sitting dazed on side walks, the road looked like corrugated iron, the Heathcote river had risen half a meter, nearly overflowing. We collected Bob from school. Fortunately the quake had hit at lunch time so most children had been outside. We drove home to Lyttelton the long way over Dyers Pass, because we knew the tunnel to Lyttelton would be closed. We had to dodge truck size boulders on the road up the pass, in Rapaki, a huge boulder had rolled down the Port Hills and smashed right through the front door of a house and rolled straight through the house, exiting at the other side, leaving the house in 2 halves.. Arriving in Lyttelton we could see straight away that the damage was massive compared to the last earth quake in September. \nWe drove up to our house, which looked OK from the street. On closer inspection we saw that the concrete foundations had split and parts of it had sunk into the ground, separating from the wooden house structure, leaving gaps between house and foundation big enough to stick my arm in. The brick archway, which separates dining from living room is at the point of collapse, with big gaps between bricks. A wall sized bookshelf has fallen and and the house is littered with broken food, lamps, pictures etc.. We could see from the structural damage that it would be suicide to enter the house. We drove down to the Rec center in Lyttelton, which doubled as the Civil Defense post. More aftershocks sent roofs rattling around us, meanwhile little Fran was hysteric with fear, crying and shouting for her Mum.\nWith no house to stay the night it didn’t take long for us to decide to drive with the children to Nelson to our relations. Normally it takes 30 minutes from Lyttelon to the Northern outskirts of Christchurch, but it took us three hours, as there was bumper to bumper traffic, the roads were either closed or wrecked, bridges gone etc. At 11 at night we arrived in Nelson, absolutely shattered and numb. We barely slept that night, relieving again and again the terrible shake and jumping up with the slightest sound.\nThe whole of Wednesday we spent in Nelson, where it was warm, sunny, peaceful, people walked around leisurely without a care in the world, which was great for the little kids, balm for our nerves, but all my husband and I could think of were our friends and our house in Christchurch.\nOn Thursday morning we left Nelson for the 6 hour drive back to Lyttelton. The closer we came to Christchurch the more apprehensive we were, going back into the ‘war zone’. Hundreds of cars were leaving Christchurch in all directions.\nWhen we finally arrived back at our house we saw that a team of engineers had been and ‘red-stickered’ it, making it officially unsafe (“entering this house can lead to injury or death”). Back at the Rec Center we met our neighbour, who had decided to leave town for a few weeks, and he offered us his house for that time. His house was checked by engineers and is 100% sound (it is a Lockwood House). As he was only leaving Friday we had to get accommodation for one night and were offered a cottage for the night at the other side of the harbour in Diamond Harbour. We had the choice of a big list of houses which people had offered for free. We spend a slightly better night there.\nFriday we moved into the neighbour’s house, which is very beautiful, clean and spacious, and we can look down into our own garden! By that time we were still in the same clothes we had been in when we went to town with the children on Tuesday morning. The only other thing we had was our wallets. So we started getting things out of our house – fortunately we had left some windows open, and we perfected a system, where I hung into the house, leaning on the window sill, my husband grabbing my legs and by using a rake, and later a brush tied onto the rake I managed to pull things towards me! Fortunately all the cupboard doors had flown open and the contents emptied on the ground, so I could rake clothing and food and shoes and some other items towards me. Obviously that left us with very odd assortments of clothes, but who cares!\nAs there was no water supply, we all went to the water tanker once a day for our ration, meeting lots of friends at the community center. A Navy boat was in the harbour, purely by chance, so they set up their tents, and we had a great lunch bbq with everyone – great sense of community. By eight o clock we were all shattered, staring into space, feeling as if we had run a marathon. We were thrilled to see that our cat Belle had survived the quake, even if she, like all of us, is very nervy.\nOn Saturday we spent a lot of time trying to get hold of engineers to find out more about the fate of our house, but no-one seems to know. We got the paper from the only shop open in Lyttelton, every other shop has been destroyed. By a stroke of luck this shop is where Bob has an after school job, so he was there slaving his guts out, as there were continuous crowds of people. My husband and I were just sitting down for a cup of tea to read the paper on our verandah, remarking how this was the first time since the earthquake that we had a quiet minute, when a Red Cross worker came running up to say we had 5 minutes to evacuate the house, the hillside was unstable and everyone had to get out!! We grabbed a bottle of water and were on the road again.\nBack to the Rec Center, where they had been told that the evacuation would be over night! Just then we met English friends of ours from Lyttelton who were off to Wellington for a few days and gave us the key to their house! While they were packing we went to the modified iconic Lyttelton Summer Street Party, which had originally been meant to happen on London street, but now had shifted to the school play ground. Local bands were playing, the local restaurants were having free gourmet bbqs, offering free coffees and chocolates and fruit – using up all the foods that otherwise would spoil. It was great, if slightly bizarre sitting there. Fortunately an hour later the evacuation area was confined to another valley and we were able to return home.\nOne week after the earthquake: At lunchtime everyone in Lyttelton gathered at the firestation, where we observed 2 minutes of silence, at the exact time when the earth quake happened a week ago. We stood together with all the fire fighters, police men, army, navy, oversees rescuers, volunteers and residents, and indeed silence seemed more appropriate than words. These 2 minutes of silence were observed around New Zealand and in part overseas\nI have lost track of exactly what we did in the last few days – the days seem to flow past in an endless round of collecting water (still no water in our house, could be weeks), talking to people, recounting/reliving all the traumatic moments again and again, trying to contact engineers about our house, government departments about lost jobs, Red Cross about long-term accommodation till we know the fate of our house, etc.\nA few impressions:\nThe aftershocks are continuing steadily. In this wooden house they sound like sonic booms under the house, violent and sharp, but more bearable than they were in our old house, where the house seemed to rattle, groan and screech much more. The aftershocks are very distressing. After a major earth quake we, like everyone here, are extremely jumpy. The slightest unexpected sound sends the body into flight reflex, the adrenalin gets pumping, you have to force yourself not to scream or run or cry, I always feel it like a kick in the gut. Experiencing this 10-12 times a day, including the night, leaves everyone drained, exhausted and tired. In the newspaper they published a list of acute stress disorder symptoms, and my husband and I have gone through every one of them: numbness, tiredness, irritability, insomnia, disconnectedness and recurring flashbacks. We are aware that we need to take it easy and look after ourselves and each other, and we are doing the best we can.\nYesterday my husband and I felt for the first time that we had some spare time and energy to try and help others. Here in Lyttelton the list of volunteers is over a hundred long – more people than are needed. So we looked on trade-me, where people are asking for help. There was a family asking to help get stuff out of their house into crates so they could store it till they could get the house repaired. The place was in a suburb close by, only 10 minutes drive from here, in Heathcote. We drove there in the morning at the time mentioned. When we arrived at the house it looked terrible – half of the roof collapsed, holes in the wall – it looked extremely dangerous, a real death trap. The idea of walking into this house gave us the creeps, it looked far worse than our house. We were very relieved when no-one turned up and we went home very quickly again, realising that it probably is safer to try and help through established channels like Civil Defence etc. We enrolled at the Civil Defence in Lyttelton as volunteers and my husband delivered food to an elderly couple in the afternoon and  got their prescription to the pharmacy etc. \nA couple of nights ago a man and his daughter turned up on our doorstep from near Belfast with a massive box of food donated to all people who had to shift from their houses. Fortunately we had enough food, so could give most of it to the Red Cross.\nLast night we had an impromptu meeting with Board members of Project Lyttelton. We met in the garden of the only church that survived the quake in Lyttelton. Only half of the Board could attend, other had left town, had lost houses, businesses, etc. We started by telling each other how we had fared over the last week. Some had spend the first few days in their houses, crying a lot, too tired and stressed to tidy up the mess, going to sleep in beds still strewn with debris that had fallen on them. The owners of the only operating shop/dairy in Lyttelton said they were utterly exhausted, because the hundreds of people that come to the shop every day mainly come to talk and off-load their stories. The owner, who is also a Local Council Member, said he was being interviewed by an international newspaper, and whilst in the midst of saying things like “We will rebuild, we are strong, etc”, he broke down and started crying. Another board member, who is a camera man for NZ TV had just spend 48 hours filming in the worst/poorest parts of Christchurch and was harrowed by what he had seen. We met to see whether there was something we could do in Lyttelton. A few ideas were floated, but the most immedeate was that people needed a place to meet and talk. \nSo the day after a friend and myself sat up a gazebo on the grassy flat in Lytteton, with tables and chairs, water and snacks and a sign “Join us, have a chat”. We had brought down bits and pieces of felt and wool and buttons and material and started to embroider and sow little hearts and handed them out to people passing by. We had company the whole day, older people walking their dogs, children on bikes, mothers with toddlers. We handed out hearts to prison wardens and guitar players and the local school teachers. In the afternoon we had dozens of children making their own hearts, little boys sowing on buttons, making hearts for their Mums, it was wonderful and heart warming. We were there till 5, and went home with a great sense of achievement. We hopefully will keep it going for as long as it is needed, we have organised a roster of dozens of people now. \n2 weeks after the earthquake:\nHelicopters circle above our house and Lyttelton daily, making sure no more huge boulders are on their way into town. One street in Lyttelton is still evacuated because of impeding rock fall, another street is evacuated because of land movement of the street above, they are afraid the street will slip down, which is not a comforting thought!\nThe days fly past without much of a rhyme or rhythm, so here are again brief impressions of life in an Earthquake zone:\nThe main thing that reduces everyone to tears here is the kindness of folks from around the world who come and help. The other day I managed to nab a bunch of engineers to come and have another look at our house and it turned out they had come from L.A, San Francisco, Vancouver and India! They confirmed that our house will be able to be repaired, unfortunately it could be weeks and months before we will get an official assessment, without which we cannot start re building as any interference before will void our insurance claim. \nA couple of days ago we farewelled the 2 huge Navy- boats which had been anchored here by chance on the day of the earthquake for a training exercise in Lyttelton port. Their presence in town made a huge difference. On the first days, when we were completely cut off, they had a small field hospital on board for people from Lyttelton who got hurt. For the first week they put up their tents and cooked lunch and dinners for everyone, which always was a very social occasion.They helped enormously with clearing broken buildings and tidying up and securing unsafe spots and just talking to everyone. We all felt safe because we felt protected by them. So- hurray for the Navy! We stood in the pouring rain with a cold, stiff Southerly wind, waving and cheering our lungs out to say thanks and good bye!\nYesterday the council put on what was advertised as a free sausage sizzle, but was more like another party with tons of food and drink and cakes and ice creams and chocolates as well as a concert of a crooner with a guitar who played lovely (and schmalzty!) Elvis and Cliff Richards etc. songs. Everyone sang along, from small kiddies to oldies, and a grand time was had by all (my freind and myself stitching of course!).\nThe generosity of all and everyone is wonderful: the local bottle-store (another shop that miraculously survived) handed out free gas bottles for all, so that everyone can use their BBQs for cooking.\nWe have continued the heart stitch meetings, but have shifted to the coffee stall on London street, which has become a bit of a meeting place. We had a couple of days of high media exposure, and ended up pinning a heart onto Ryan Nelson’s broad chest. He wore the heart in the evening for a TV 1 interview on the news. The same day I ‘accosted’ a group of soldiers in uniform (there seem to be more soldiers around here than civilians!), having a friendly chat with one, when he introduced me to General Jones, who turned out to be the head of the NZ Defense Force! Nice chap! Next up was the Minister of Defence! By that time we were a bit over celebrities!\nThe next day another group of semi-official dudes (Why is it always blokes?!) walked past. We called them over and joked around and a chap in shirt sleeves remarked that he had seen the Minister of Defence last night at a function wearing the heart. I quipped saying that unless he was a minister he certainly wouldn’t get one of our precious hearts when an aide came over to me informing me I was talking to the Minister of Internal Affairs, so I did after all have to hand out a heart! \nWe go into the third week now without water, which is not that nice. Even those households that have water have to cook the water, because so many pipes broke that there is no guarentee that the water is clean, it may all be mixed with untreated sewage, so boiling is the order of the day, and it even after boiling it does not taste very nice. No water of course also means no showers, no washing machine, no proper toilets…\nThe aftershocks seem to be petering off, but when they come they are quite violent. Those sonic booms under the carpet lift the house and drop it again, make my heart race and pump adrenalin through the body and after several of those ‘attacks’ a day we all feel exhausted and jumpy.",

        "text": "Day 4: On Friday, my husband returned to work and I rode with him in his 4WD.  I can’t remember now if it was Friday morning or Saturday when we were able to travel over the bridge and down Ferry Road, through Ferrymead.  Friday morning, I think.\nThat road was one massive mess, full of ripples, holes, dips, rises, and cracks.  My husband joked that it was more 4wd than the recent trip we’d done on the Ashley River (just the weekend before – seems so long ago).  Thing is, it was definitely more of an obstacle course than a roadway.\nWe each had a quick shower when we got to my workplace, and then my husband headed off to his office, maybe 5-6km away from mine.  We had agreed we would leave work around 1pm, so got to work getting everything done that needed to be done.\nI mentioned a shower at my workplace, which is located on the western side of town.  Much was written about the tale of three cities – those with water/electricity, those without, and the so-called red zone (the central city).  Most of the damage was confined to the eastern suburbs and central city, and having access to showers was a godsend.  We had many calls and offers to sleep and shower at friends’ homes, but just wanted to be home as much as possible.\nI was over the moon when I learned that, as I’d requested and hoped, someone driving in from Timaru had been able to bring back four bags of ice.  Woot!  We would be able to keep drinks and food cold over the weekend; you wouldn’t believe how good that made me feel.  No power, no water, no sewage, but hey, we would have cold drinks and I could have mayonnaise for my sandwiches.\nAt 1pm, my husband and I tossed three of the bags of ice in the chilly bin and headed off to Countdown just a few blocks away from my workplace.  We bought enough supplies for the weekend and started our long journey home.\nI think it was this night that our neighbours came over for a drink and a chat after dinner, and we sat on our deck for a while.  Afterward, I went to bed fairly early not to sleep but to get warm, as once again I was freezing.  I listened to the radio and just before 9pm leapt out of bed when I heard that the street lamps in Sumner had come on.  I was ever hopeful that that meant our own electricity would soon be on; even though it wasn’t, that development gave me hope that we would have electicity soonish.  That hope was nearly destroyed a few times in coming days when we would get conflicting reports about how long it might take to get electricity.\nEvery time I awoke in the night, I looked to make sure those lights were still on.  Like the battery-operated radio, those lights became a lifeline.\nDays 5/6 (The Weekend) With the street lights having come on the night before, we half-expected to have electricity on Saturday, but it wasn’t to be.\nWe started our day talking with neighbours from up the hill, and touring a couple of the hard-hit properties at the end of our drive.  One of them (red-tiled roof) was the front-page photo of the Press one morning, with every wall down; shortly after we had a look, the owners showed up with a crew of men wearing hard hats to remove all their personal items.\nWe also found the woman who’d been calling out for her lost cat several times a day, but sadly the cat that turned up at our neighbour’s home was not the one she was seeking.  Her house sat against a cliff, and had been compromised by a rockfall, with rocks crashing through the back of her home.\nWe later ventured away from Sumner to go to a family member’s home in order to wash dishes.  That proved to be a mission as so many roads were closed.  We originally planned to drive down Linwood to the river and then onto Bealey Ave, down Cranford, and onto McFaddens Road.\nDidn’t happen.\nWe ended up finding our way over to Fitzgerald, seeing the tanks and trucks which are blocking access to the central city.  We turned toward Moorhouse and alongside Hagley Park to the far end of Bealey Ave, and got back to Cranford from that direction.\nIt was at the nephew’s home that we finally access the internet and were able to leave some messages for family and friends.  We also did a couple containers of dishes – everything we had left, which was not broken.\nLeaving there, we went to Riccarton to try to find somewhere to have a late lunch/early dinner around 3pm.  As expected, most things were closed, but we did find a Robbie’s Restaurant which was open.  Alister had a lambs fry and bacon meal with mashed potatoes, and I had fish and chips.  It was nice to have a meal not cooked on our campstove.\nBack home, we were disheartened to still not have electricity, but happy to see that the street lights came on again at dark.  I think I may have written that I slept in the recliner on Friday night, but it was actually Saturday night that I did that, after failing to fall asleep in bed.  I mostly catnapped, but was able to look out at the moonlit ocean.\nSunday is pretty much a blur.  Some time that morning the electric company came by to make sure we were safe in regards to having the power turned back on; we were given a green card, but some properties at the end of the drive were disconnected as they are unsafe.  This person told my husband that it would be up to 2 weeks before our electricity was reconnected.  That was hard to hear.\nI think it was this day that we went down to the beach to collect some sea water to flush the toilet (which we are using at night, with a guilty conscience).  Our clock tower is still standing, with the clocks stopped at 12:51pm.\nAt some point this afternoon my husband went down the hill for some reason, and came back up to say that electricity was back on in most of Sumner.  We checked our own electricity and it was working.\nYay!\nWe turned it off again and made sure everything was turned off.  We then tested room by room to make sure that everything was working properly.  Next thing to do would be to turn on the computers; they were slow to start up, but finally did.\nThe TV, however, was stuffed.  We’d known there was an indention in the screen, but when we turned it on the light showed us how badly the screen was broken, looking a bit like a big spiderweb.\nWe still do not have water or sewage, but just getting our power back was a huge success for us.  Being able to put away the flashlights and to have a clock and to be able to access the internet…. It was so amazing.",

        "text": "I had just left my husband at the Botanical Gardens and was driving home along Fitzgerald Avenue when the earthquake hit. I had hoped we would both go home together, as I had a strange feeling that day that I wanted to stay close to him, but brushing it aside we decided it made more sense if I just saw him at home. I was therefore on my own, just crossing the small bridge at Kilmore Street when the car started to shake violently. \nInitially I thought it was a strong cross wind as the trees were also swaying, but as I started to see the road concertina in front of me, I realised it was another massive earthquake. By this time I had slammed on my brakes and I remember swearing constantly under my breath. Realising that the road had crumpled up behind me too, I got out of my car. There were three of us on the bridge, one girl screaming as she pointed to a crumbling building behind us, which she had been in minutes before. In a complete daze I asked someone on River Road if it was possible to go that way, but was told it was also blocked. Having paired up with the other girl, who was now a good deal calmer, we walked to the partially collapsed buildings along Fitzgerald to see if there was anything we could do. After some minutes it became clear that the men who were there helping did not need us, and to be truthful, in my dazed state I’m not sure I would have been much help anyway. We therefore decided to walk home as we both lived near Burwood Park and that walk turned out to be a very surreal journey. With the roads all flooded and people milling about, it made for difficult terrain. There was some comfort though, being in the suburbs, as it was easy to gauge the devastation in the CBD purely from the small corner we had seen; here at least buildings were standing and people, though shocked I’m sure, hadn’t yet learnt what had happened to their city. On finally reaching home I was disturbed to find my husband wasn’t there as I realised this meant he had to have been in the city. After speaking to some neighbours, who were pulling together in the beautiful spirit we were to see all over Christchurch, I sat myself on the kerb waiting for my husband. It was a very difficult wait, but to my huge relief, he turned up an hour later sweating and equally shocked from his experience in the city. Having been apart when the earthquake struck, I experienced separation anxiety for a long time after the event. I still shake with adrenaline when I think back to what happened that day. Recently someone spoke to me about Post Traumatic Stress and how I was still feeling the effects of it… strange thing was I never even thought I had PTS, but when you think of it, if an earthquake isn’t a traumatic event, then what is! My husband and I have now returned to the UK, but we have left our hearts in Christchurch. We have nothing but love and admiration for the strength and beauty of spirit we saw in the people there.",

Once the shaking had stopped, while trying to hold back tears I quickly drove to Playcentre to make sure one of the Mums that I was looking for wasn’t there, she wasn’t, I turned around informed the neighbours what the dust cloud was from then drove back home.  The smooth road I had driven along before was all buckled and bent, I pulled up the drive, jumped out raced in to the house to grab Lauren’s buggy so that I could have her safe while I went to find some company only to discover that my house was completely trashed, things had been ejected from every cupboard and all the shelves, I dug out the buggy from under a mountain of pantry items where it had rolled and then noticed our huge window in the lounge had shattered so I closed the door to stop the cat from getting out, went outside, grabbed the kids and went back down the road to where there were people where I told them that I was there for some adult company and they were very pleased to oblige, once they open again I’ll be popping in to say thanks that’s for sure!\nThere were cracks in the road, liquefaction in the park across the river and general bedlam.

Once he was home we boarded up the window and made the house live able.  We have coped reasonably well even after we lost our land line for a day and a half due to the batteries on the exchange dying which they eventually replaced with a generator.  This afternoon after arranging for fresh ice bottles for the chilly bin and a generator we got home to discover that we had power.  Tonight friends invited us out for a proper dinner where we shouldn’t have to worry about aftershocks and could have a proper shower and we’ve ended up staying the night, it’s nice not to worry about the shaking for a few hours but will be good to get home and properly clean the house now we can take the covering off the floor and clean up the glass properly. \nWe are all safe and well, we’ve been coping much better than September and Mark even went to work on Friday with my blessing and I stayed at home with the kids on my own which I wouldn’t have even thought about in September.  Mark’s new employer has been brilliant, they are putting the power back on but have stressed that family comes first and not to come in until you are happy that your family and house will be ok without you, he gets in and is given a lunch bag, starts at 7.30am and is home by 5pm pretty much, on the first day they sent him home with bottled water and loaves of bread.\nSorry for the messy post but that’s about how my brain is working at the moment!",

        "text": "February 2011: My bed for the last week is a large size airbed on the lounge floor, occupied by myself and two frightened children. At night we huddle close, sing brave songs and sleep restlessly. Around the airbed there are some vital supplies – two hand-winding torches, a bottle of water, and a basket containing my car keys, handbag and a small bag of lollies. My husband sleeps upstairs, where the room rock’n’rolls on a regular basis. At night, the house is pitch black, and quiet bar the sound of army helicopters and sirens wailing through the night.\nI close my eyes. I don’t like to close my eyes; images flood in – it’s 12.45 on a Tuesday; I’m lounging on the sofa at home, calling to Charlotte, “it’s time to get dressed for Fairy Dancing” and she, “I love Fairy dancing,” skipping down the hall – but then, the floor pulls away from her and the walls move in towards me as a horrendous roaring fills the air. The room pulls back away from me and the roaring is joined by Charlotte’s screams as pictures leap from the walls, glasses from cupboards and ornaments and toys dance out of their places in a wild rumba, smashing on the ground around Charlotte’s small, bare feet. I try to get to her but the floor throws me down again, and all I can hear is our screams as the world tosses wildly about us. The floor is still jiving when I get to her, pulling her into my arms and we both sob, huddled down in a sea of broken glass.\n“Mummy, mum that was an earthquake” she says, breathlessly hysterical, “and I wasn’t scared!” like that’s the most important thing, not to be scared.\n\nI brush hair out of her grey eyes, “Yes it was honey, and I was scared.”\n\nWe walk outside to a world removed. Porritt Park is flooded again, the second time in less than six months. Water gushes from a number of shattered pipes and a geyser of grey silt flows onto our lawn. Charlotte calls it a mud-well. She says it stinks like poohs.\nI text my husband who’s at a business meeting; is he OK? Can he get Tim from school? He is, he can – he’s already on the way. Neighbours start to come out onto the street and Charlotte and I walk the line, down to the old couple at the corner and back checking that everyone is OK. We feel safer doing this than staying in the moving house with wobbly walls, feel a little bit important like somehow, our walking the line helps. There’s a sense of desolation this time; after September fourth, there was a strange, mystical sense of something magical, of somehow being touched by angels. Maybe because that was the middle of the night and so ethereal, maybe because no-one died. Charlotte and I, we knew by the pure violence that something more malevolent had hit us this time.\nAbout half an hour later the cars started coming from town, a steady, bumper-to-bumper stream of them pouring home, rushing over the broken streets through mud and silt up to the bumpers to see if they still had homes, had families and pets to rush home to. Then the foot traffic begins, dozens and then hundreds of exhausted, filthy people struggling through knee deep sludge and sewerage, in their work clothes; ladies in high heels with feet torn and blistered, men in suits with the jackets, ties and shirts thrown over their arms. They walk with out talking, without looking, and when I look at their faces, they have the blank, nothing gaze of Stepford Wives. I’d seen that look before, in the eyes of a rabbit I found that had been hit by a car. Seeing something that was stuck in its mind, something terrible that wasn’t there any more but was still in its eyes.\nCharlotte and I stand at the gate for ages, waiting for Sam and Tim to come home. After a while we bring out a bottle of orange juice and some biscuits, giving them out with hugs and smiles which seem weak. We hear stories of things that will haunt me forever, even though I wasn’t there to see the things – hearing them is enough. \nThe girl down the road comes home from school, falls crying into my arms and joins us giving out juice. We give gumboots to someone whose shoes had fallen apart, old sneakers to another. Later when it starts to get dark and drizzly, I try to drive someone home but the roads have turned into mud rivers and I can only go a few hundred metres before having to turn back. The woman walks to her brother in laws’ house, through the mud and rain and pitch dark with only a bent umbrella as protection against the horror of that day.\nFinally Sam gets home, five hours to drive from Ilam to Avondale. We sit in the car with mugs of tea boiled on my camp stove – we have no power or water – and listen to the radio. Twenty-two bridges are down. There are buildings fallen and still falling everywhere. People have died, and are dying. Sam tells me of the devastation of the city, how he had to drive all over, through gridlock traffic, to find a way home. He tells me the Fairy Dancing building has collapsed, and I burst into tears. We go back inside and curl up with the children in a nest of cushions on the lounge floor. It’s days before I go back upstairs to face the ruins of my room.",

        "text": "For me there are four stories:\nSept 4th was an event.  It was terrifying, woke up to the roar then the shaking, couldn’t get out of bed, got to my kids when the first shake stopped only to experience the first aftershock. Cellphones provided light.  We were all safe and unhurt. The chimneys had fallen down and until this happens you have absolutely no idea just how many bricks are in a chimney, the car was crushed, there was a big hole in the roof and the other chimney was in the neighbours driveway.  But, when daylight came we had the most glorious day and that beautiful day enabled us to get on, pick ourselves up, and do what had to be done to make our home safe and make practical arrangements.  Yes, we had lots of aftershocks both that day and in the following months, but we believed all that time it was a one off event and we were getting over it and moving on with life. \nBoxing Day is supposed to be a fun family day.  Dropped one child off at Riccarton Mall as she was working, the other was meeting a friend there to go sales shopping. Although neither Boxing Day shopping or Riccarton Mall are really my thing we decided to have a wander around anyway.  We were browsing in Borders when all of a sudden the ground just seemed to lurch up with no warning and the noise was terrible.  Books were flying off the shelves and people were screaming.  People evacuated from the main mall and other stores and we all stood around in Rotherham Street just under the air bridge (how stupid)..\nPeople were crying and everyone was texting.  Found daughter working in mall was safe, discovered the other one was now in a mall on the other side of town.  We had parked on the street.  There was a mass exodus from Riccarton Mall but as fast as people were driving away in their cars more cars were driving into the car parks – it was bizarre.  Broke my heart leaving my older daughter who was working there at the mall.  Went home to charge cell phone, no power, went to Mum’s to charge cellphone, went to Palms to pick up other child – had earthquakes eveywhere that day.  There were more then 20 earthquakes in less than eight hours that day  we felt them all – it sends so much adrenalin into your body you almost become physically ill. \nFebruary 22nd – I am a chef and we were at work all feeling pretty good about life, things were picking up and we getting busy – to pre earthquake levels.  There were three of us in the kitchen and there was a small shake and we had time to glance at each other and shrug as if to say “aftershock” then it was just as if the world exploded and the ground was heaving.  Every plate, kitchen utensil and all those jars of spices and mixes we have on high shelves became flying missiles,  I ended up on the floor in the smashed mess cut and bleeding.  \nSomehow we hurled our way out the sliding kitchen door to the car park and the rest of the staff and customers were outside.  Sirens, continuous sirens, and sobbing.  We stayed in the car park for ages trying to contact family.  Got my oldest daughter at university – told her to make her way home.  Got my youngest who was in Latimer Square (been teacher’s half day and they were all going into town).  Told her to stay there and under no circumstances to move.  My partner was on leave that day, got hold of him and told him he would have to bike into town to get her, he txt me half way there and said wasn’t sure he could get through as roads were awash, told him he had to keep going.  Aftershocks kept happening, for one I was looking at the mirror glass building across the road – I wanted to vomit.  For another I was watching our little weatherboard building and the shock just ripples along the boards in one end and out the other.  \nOne image from the earthquakes sticks with me – there was a guy running full tilt into town against the exodus of people.  He was not a fit looking guy but he was flying.  About 25 minutes later he was walking back to town with a girl about 10 – obviously his daughter.  That really moved me.  We locked up and made our way to where we park our cars in Bealey Ave,  everyone was being hearded across by the Knox Church as the front facades of Saggi de Vino and the building next door were hanging out into the street.  Once  in my car I had to go with the flow of traffic so ended up in Ilam before I could get a turn to take me back to St Albans.  Thought before I go home will go back towards town to try and pick up partner and daughter halfway.  Although there had been some liquifaction on earlier streets it had only been just on the surface, got to Madras/Forfar corner and it was a couple of feet deep but you don’t have the choice to stop you just have to keep going in the flow of traffic. Saw my daughter’s best friend with someone else and told them to jump in.  Driving through the liquifaction is terrifying as you simply have no idea what is underneath you and believe me once it has drained away and you see the state of the roads you are right to be scared.  Got home, went inside, big items all in place, kitchen a disaster zone.  Common theme is that chilli sauce makes the worst mess so always keep it at the back of the cupboard.  Didn’t want to stay in house, sat in the car just fine till next door neighbour came over and I started shaking in a state of shock.  Then partner and youngest daughter got home.  Made half hearted attempt to clean up but no water or power.  Extended family came over and we all went to my brother-in-laws house to stay for the next week.  \nNo work due to cordon then because of dangerous buildings next door to  my workplace, daughter on afternoon school after a month. Emergency boxes now live permanently by front door.  All of our extended family have moved back up north so we feel quite socially isolated.  Nothing will ever be the same.\nJune 13th – my boss had come up with some alternative premises as a temporary measure.  Terrible shaking, glasses smashing, all the containers falling, ran through cafe and out onto the street, hyperventilating on footpath and watching debris falling off the Crown Plaza.  30 minutes to end of shift so force myself to go back to work to help clean up, customers keep coming in so keep on serving meals.  Never so glad to get to end of shift.  Race home, daughter txts can I pick her up from school. Jump in car and get just round the corner from home. Think to myself the road must have really got munted again then realise its another earthquake.  Watch a mother with a pram get thrown to the ground and her baby fell out – some Shirley High boys go to her rescue and an elderly couple hold on to the lampost.  Crawl my way to the other side of town to Burnside High  and all the girls are on the field.  Grab the ones I have come to collect and crawl home again.  Aftershocks all night.  But now off work again as building next door to temporary premises critically dangerous.  \nThe effect of these events is ongoing and many aspects of our lives have been changed forever.  Young people in Christchurch have lost so much but will also have gained a resilience and sense of community that would be had to find elsewhere.  Hope it is all over.",

We didnt know what had happened as there was no warning. Then an aftershock came very violently and our bus driver helped everyone get off the bus. I wandered along Manchester St to witness buildings crashing with dust almost impossible to breathe.  I decided to make for Latimer Square, people screaming, running, crying, total chaos to say the least.  In Latimer Square by this time was filling with people shocked and dazed and bewildered. Stayed for a while phones were down, traffic gridlocked so decided to walk home to Parklands.  \nHundreds of people were walking very caring of those around. I was getting very tired but knew there was no other way to go home.  About 1 km from home I was picked up by someone I knew and dropped near my house. I felt Id been on a movie set it certainly didnt feel like reality. I arrived home hours later to find smashed cabinets, broken crystal and china, a real mess. \nSome 7 aftershocks that day and night, all very frightening. Two cars ended up buried in liquifaction in my street and had no power, sewer, water for many days.  It all seems so unreal all this time later. When hearing the full extend of the news and devastation which followed I am very grateful to still be alive.  I havent or dont intend to move away out of Christchurch at this stage.",

        "text": "On February 22nd 2011 I got up as usual, dropped my daughter at preschool in the building next to my work in the suburb of Woolston on Christchurch’s eastern side, taught 2 classes and then packed up at 12.30 ready for our secondary teachers’ union meeting in the Christchurch Town Hall. I headed off to the meeting with my new boss in my car, and with another colleague, following behind in his van.  He parked in Kilmore Street, just down from where Piko Wholefoods is/was. I parked in an old carpark building next to the Rep Theatre in Kilmore St, a building badly damaged by the September 4th quake. \nThe three of us walked along Kilmore towards the Town Hall. We had just crossed Colombo Street, when I remember something catching my attention, maybe a sound. I turned to my boss and started to say, “Is that…” when I was flung to the ground. To my right was a large truck parked in a loading zone. To my left was a patch of grass that stretched out a few metres before it edged up against the tall concrete wall of the Town Hall.\nI remember bouncing on the ground as if I was on a trampoline. Curling up in a ball was all I could do to protect myself. I remember seeing my boss doing the same. As I looked left I saw the wall of the Town Hall bending towards the ground like rubber, seemingly only centimetres away. To my right my other colleague was holding onto the thick metal post of the loading zone sign. It was flexing like a big rubber band, waving from side to side, nearly bending to touch the ground. I remember thinking, “wow, he can stand, I wish I could!” He was shouting to us, “get away from the wall, get up against the truck!” I wanted to move away from the wall but I couldn’t. I couldn’t even crawl. Then somehow the shaking stopped.\nI still cannot remember a single sound between about 12.51 that day and about 1.05 when the first large aftershock hit. I do not remember how I stood up or how I crossed the street. The sound during and after the quake must’ve been deafening, as when I crossed to the other corner of Kilmore and Colombo, closer to the river, I realized, looking up and down Colombo Street, that buildings were down in every direction.\nThere are a few things I remember between 12.51 and 2.00, when I arrived back to my daughter’s preschool. I remember hugging random strangers on the corner of Kilmore and Colombo. I remember no sounds, but I remember their faces so clearly that if I saw them in the street today I would stop and talk to them. I remember telling a few people who were by themselves to get the hell out of town. I remember my colleague yelling to me that we had to get out of the CBD. I remember looking up Kilmore Street, seeing huge piles of rubble around where my car was and thinking, “I’m not getting my car”. I remember texting my family “I’m OK”. I remember nearly tugging my boss’ arm out of its socket, nearly dragging her in my desperation to get out, away from the tall buildings. I remember stubbing my toes multiple times because I was wearing strappy sandals and the footpath was suddenly tearing up beneath me as the liquefaction took hold underfoot.\nBut by far the worst thing I remember as we walked along Cambridge Tce (alongside the Avon River) in order to avoid the high rises, trudging through ankle deep sewage and liquefaction, was the PGC building. When I saw that collapsed I just lost it. If my colleagues hadn’t yelled at me to stop looking I don’t think I could’ve moved.\nI remember walking (quickly) around and past the cracked and leaning band rotunda, slipping all over the show in silt and water from the liquefaction.  I remember crossing Manchester Street, where drivers were still sitting stationary and dazed in their cars. We crossed the Kilmore Street bridge by the fire station, where cars were stuck because the ground leading up to the bridge had sunk. I remember seeing people standing outside Centennial Pools in their togs, wrapped in survival blankets, wondering what to do and where to go. I remember seeing the Central Fire Station springing into action, and seeing several fire trucks whizzing past into the chaos.\nI remember when we were next to Pico Wholefoods as this was when the first big aftershock hit. My colleague yanked me out onto the road as a shower of rubble from the Herb Dispensary hit the footpath where I had been walking. From here on we walked in the middle of the road. \nThen there was the 45 minute drive to Woolston from Kilmore Street, a drive that would normally take 5-10 minutes. We only made it that fast because my colleague drove on the median strip, up on footpaths, along Avonside Drive, Stanmore Road and then to Ferry Road. I think we were expecting things to get better as we headed out of the CBD. But they didn’t. Every house older than about 40 years was a twisted mess. The road had unzipped, crumpled, opened up into craters. People had abandoned their cars and were walking. \nWe arrived at school at 2.00. Already the entire carpark and grounds was a wet, smelly liquefaction pit. I remember jumping out of the van while it was still moving and running to my daughter. I don’t think I let go of her for a long time. And then started the long wait to assemble with family who worked in the CBD, to start the long drive to our homes in Sumner together…",

        "text": "February 22nd 2011 – I was at home when the quake struck. The impact of the shock wave threw me from a seated position to the floor. I stayed there as the entire house shook violently. I prayed. When the shaking stopped, I raced outside wearing only a tee shirt, shorts and jandals. I was so anxious to leave the house that I threw open the ranch slider door of the lounge and jumped the side fence to the street, not bothering to open a garden gate. \nAs I stood in the street, the edges of the road began to splutter and liquifaction oozed menacingly from all the sides and the sewer grate in the middle of the road. Neighbours gathered in the street but I was so fazed by it all I cannot recall what was said. I tried to use my cell phone to call my wife but, of course, it could not connect. Cautiously, I re-entered the house as aftershocks started, threw on some warmer clothes and shoes, grabbed my car keys and made my way to Hagely Park – the assembly point my wife and I had long ago agreed upon. When I arrived there, a small band of people had gathered already. Although total strangers, we mingled and talked like old friends. It had become quite cold and someone from the group kindly lent me an overcoat. \nMore aftershocks struck. I saw the verandah of a nearby building on Riccarton Rd collapse onto a car (later I learned someone had died there). Trees in the park moved in unison as aftershocks struck like they were at the centre of a hurricane force wind. Birds stayed in the air, themselves fearful of staying too long on tree branches. And then I saw the CBD dwellers staggering out of the city, looking so lost and shocked, some covered in dust .It reminded me of 911 in New York. Tales were shared and I learned the horrible truth that buildings had collapsed and that people had died.\n\nPhilip",

        "text": "Like many I sat in my home on the evening of the 22nd of February stunned by the events of the day but felt blessed that I, my family and everything we had had been spared. When the earthquake struck I was in an Advanced Land Law lecture at Canterbury University. Like most it took me hours to get home, which we found to have been spared from the quake. That evening I was informed that a friends home in the Eastern Suburbs had been extensively damaged and so I decided that the next day he would go shovel in hand to help.\nWhat I saw on that first day created a desire to help all those that I came across and made me ask the question ‘what else can I do to help?’ The group that I was with were fortunate to have the services of a Bobcat which gave rise to the idea which enabled me to assist hundreds of homeowners through the removal of thousands of tonnes of liquefaction.\nFortunate to have many friends, I called on each of them on the night of the 23rd of February, and asked for their help. The response was immediate with thousands of dollars being donated from friends in Auckland, Wellington and abroad. \nFurther to calling my friends I called the Head Offices of all the major hardware chains asking for supplies as that day I had seen elderly homeowners using buckets to clear liquefaction. The response I received was generous with the next morning spent collecting thousands of dollars worth of donated goods from Mitre 10, the Warehouse and numerous other retailers and then dispersing these to homeowners in the Eastern Suburbs.\nWith the funds received plus my own savings, I ignored my own financial situation, considering myself fortunate having recently moved from the central city to a new home on the outskirts of Christchurch believing that I would simply increase my mortgage to replace the monies he spent.\nWith an orange flashing light borrowed from the neighbouring farmer I led trucks carrying heavy machinery into the Eastern Suburbs. What started as a bobcat and a digger soon grew to four bobcats and four diggers whom at my direction for three weeks went house to house street to street clearing liquefaction at no charge with those residents offerering payment being flatly refused and contractors found charging for do the same work asked to leave. Word soon spread amongst the community of my efforts and as a result I received $70,000.00 comprising cash and diesel from Rotary International to further fund his endeavours. \nWhilst the machines roared in and out of driveways I walked the streets accompanied by my colossal canine companion, Guinness the Irish Wolfhound aka ‘Earthquake Dog’ whose therapeutic value was soon recognised as most that they came across relished in the opportunity to discuss the dog rather than the earthquake with many children to the delight of their parents receiving their first ever dog ride.\nIn the evenings I would spend his time rallying more support. I remember seeing an elderly Chinese women using a bucket to remove liquefaction which gave me the idea to organise a wheelbarrow appeal in Auckland. I spoke with Pam Corkery on Newstalk ZB and appealed to Aucklanders to donate wheelbarrows – the response was overwhelming as within a week I received 225 wheelbarrows, 750 shovels, 150 assorted gardening tools, 2 tents, 1 leaf blower a toilet and 1100 bottles of water many of the items containing messages of support.\nWith the aid of a trailer I throughout the day and night gave away all of the items I received. I remember fondly coming across an elderly women scooping up water from the gutter to use for her roses. I managed to persuade her that the bottled water that I had would be much better and after convincing her that I had over 1000 bottles left the two of us took pleasure in watering roses with bottled water. I also met Hillary a lady I think in her 80’s who had no power was cold and had been using a bucket for a toilet for nearly two weeks. It was great that I managed to find a good home for the toilet that was sent to me from Auckland and that I was able to convince staff at Mitre 10 to go halves in a gas heater and bottle for which I left on the doorstep of Hillarys’ broken home.\nWhilst most of the days were spent alongside my fellow students with my fleet of machines regarded as the ‘unofficial’ heavy machinery support for the Student Volunteer Army I recall the day that I received a call from the New Zealand Army who requested my teams assistance to support troops in Retreat Rd. I believe that I may be the only civilian that has provided heavy machinery support to both New Zealand Armys on domestic shores during a National State of Emergency.\nI constantly tried to do more, and made a passionate plea to a friend in Auckland to help me stage a concert for the Student Volunteer Army in a tent in my back paddock which I believed that if I was able to get the right band I would be able to generate global exposure for Christchurch. My goal was for the concert to kick-start a viral campaign via the internet, with Christchurch as the focus. I asked my friend, Russ Wilkinson, past Deputy Chairman of Foodstuffs NI to get me U2, the response I received was ‘you’re crazy, but I happen to know Sir Michael Fay, I’ll ask him.’ Whilst this was a big dream and a long shot, but I remains proud that Sir Michael Fay in his words had ‘numerous discussions’ with his contacts at the U2 organisation. The idea was put to the band and they thought about it, that’s’ not bad for a 3rd year law student from Canterbury University.\nAfter 2 weeks working 12 hours per day in the Eastern Suburbs and then at least 6 hours every night blogging and rallying others, the effects of exhaustion started to set in. I had been reluctant to accept food whilst working during the day preferring to wait until he got home as his fridge was fill and most I met could not use theirs. After 22 days working without rest I was admitted by friends to hospital so that I could recuperate. My stay in hospital lasted two weeks and whilst my body rested my mind did not. \nUpon discharge I decided to travel to the North Island to personally thank all those that had assisted me in my efforts including those that had sent wheelbarrows with contact details in particular the kids at Glenbrook Kindergarten in Auckland who had painted and sent a wheelbarrow to Christchurch. \nI had my car decorated ‘Christchurch is Broken – help us fix it’, packed ‘earthquake’ dog and a pot of liquefaction, strapped the Glenbrook Kindergarten wheelbarrow to the rear wheel and set off on a 10,000km journey. \nWhilst in Auckland I attended an Entreprenuers workshop at Auckland University in order to obtain guidance for an idea that I had been developing since soon after the earthquake. I was advised at the workshop that this idea ‘HelpNZ’, was a Social Enterprise. The intention is for funds to be collected from which to subsidise the wages of skilled undergraduates for the benefit of Christchurch businesses that have been effected by the earthquake whilst continuing to foster the volunteer culture of Canterbury University students by having the students available to those that provide the funds to perform volunteer work at the donors direction. I believe that such an Enterprise would benefit students through work experience, businesses through affordable skilled labour, communities through volunteer work and the economy as students generally spend rather than save. Whilst HelpNZ is a work in progress I do have the ability to promote the idea worldwide as a friend has offered me space on the side of retail packaging for lightbulbs, the particular bulbs having sold in excess of 5,000,000 units worldwide in the past four years.\nI further developed a partnership with NZ Pet Doctors, a national vet chain whom have been promoting the earthquake using imagery of Guinness. We are currently discussing the logistics of  visiting schools to promote volunteering, earthquakes and animal welfare. The idea followed my attendance at Kerikeri High School and Russell Primary School where I shared my experiences with the children who had more questions about the dog that the earthquakes. \nOn hearing of the June Earthquake, I returned to Christchurch to once again assist the resident of the eastern suburbs and to wait for the reopening of University in 2012 so that I may continue my Law degree.\n\nIt has been a big year.",

Then the rain comes lopping down, drop by drop it flows like a drum and the joyful beat fills my ears. Mum bangs around in the kitchen but I don’t notice as I stare out the window. I hear a low pitch hum as a plane peacefully flies above my house.\nA giant rumble awakes me. Certainly that’s not my tummy at this time of the morning. My bed shakes violently. My mind races around in confusion. Hush, hush. Can’t you hear that? I bounce out of bed. I voyage my way to the doorway. Standing, shivering. I feel my knees knocking against one another. I don’t know who is shaking more, me or the ground. “Door way” I hear my Dad shout. I see my brother and sister appear at their doorways. Their pale white faces appear in the faint glow of the alarm keyboard. Bang! Crash! Thud! I watch my wardrobe door open and close, open and close. Lights sway. Books fall. Hearts pound. Teeth chatter. Ears listen. Eyes see. I hear sequels. I feel hopeless and scared. I see thing flying around. “Bomb!” I hear my Mum yell. Bomb? I question as l let my body sway left to right. I have no control. I feel like a puppet someone else is pulling my strings. What’s happening? What is it? It can’t be a bomb… l look toward my sister. I can tell what she’s thinking… earthquake\nSuddenly the ground calms down. I look around my room; papers and book scatter the floor. The power is gone. Roar! The shaking starts again. I hold on to the doorway with clenched fists. It’s not over yet. How wrong was I? This solid, flat ground that I had walked, ran, hopped, skipped, and jumped on could not be trusted. How could the ground be so strong and tough but yet weak and vulnerable at the same time? My house my sturdy brick house that I always kicked a ball against and watched it as it came rebounding back to me. My ball didn’t stand a chance. How? How did this freak of nature shake the one place that I trusted? How did my house sway like a tree in a strong breeze?\nThe biggest mistake, I have ever made was believing I was safe. Believing that I was invincible. Even though I didn’t believe in “Santa Clause “ or the “tooth fairy”  anymore, I still was just an innocent girl , innocent in thinking, I was safe. I remember watching the six o clock news looking at disasters occurring right in front of my eyes. I thought that would never happen to me. I would never be put in a situation like that, but how terribly wrong I was.\nNow I sit on the edge of the sofa and can barely concentrate on reading my book. I jump with fright and the breeze blows violently outside and bashes against the window cell. Then the rain thuds down making no effort to make a beat, it just pounds down, drop by drop, the sound frightens me as it reminds me of my wardrobe door opening and closing. Mum bangs pots and pans around in the kitchen as my heart pounds harder, thinking another earthquake is coming. I can’t bring myself to look out the window. Roar, groan, I hear a plane nosily fly above my house, it reminds me of the roar, the roar that comes before and earthquake.\nNow I live in fear and I know that my life will never be the same again.",

My daughter had been in an accident the previous day, and was at home on crutches.\nI decided to go get some KFC for lunch, to cheer her up. Leaving her on the couch with my brother, I hopped in my car and drove through the back streets of Riccarton.\nI remember thinking to myself – “It’s payday, I need to get some groceries, and register my car. I’ll do that when hubby gets home.” Yeah Right. Three minutes later, my everyday drive down the road, turned into the scariest moment of my life.\nI was driving west to east at 12:51. Suddenly, the steering of my 94 Toyota began to veer to the left, then the right. “Damn, have I blown a steering rod?” Was my first thought, as I fought to keep control. Then I realised that the buildings around me were shaking violently. I hit the brakes, and continued to fight the steering wheel, as a parked grey Nissan loomed closer, it’s owner holding onto the boot spoiler, desparate to stay upright. My car veered towards the Nissan, and, fighting panic, I pressed the brakes as hard as I could, and threw the steering wheel towards the centre-line. The car pulled to a stop within inches of the Nissan. I put the car in ‘Park’, and cut the engine. The shaking hadn’t stopped though, and I felt queasy from motion sickness, panic and fear. Then, it stopped, as suddenly as it had begun.\nI climbed out of the car. For a few seconds, an eerie silence hung over the street. “Are you OK?” I asked the Nissan lady. “I’m OK. You,” “I’m OK.” I got back into my car, and pulled a fast U-turn.  What followed was the longest 5 minute drive home I’ve ever had. Were my kids OK? Two of them were at school, were the schools trashed? Is my brother alright? God, where was my husband? I stopped several times to check on the dazed, frightened people who stumbled out of their homes as I passed.  When I finally arrived home, I ran into my brother’s arms. The fear came out as I sobbed on his shoulder. \nIt wasn’t until nearly three hours later, once hubby came home, and we got our kids home safe, that we turned on the TV and saw the devastation in the central city. Amongst those scared, wounded people were my colleagues and friends. I worked in a multi-storied building in town.  I was supposed to be there on February 22. I wasn’t. I was spared, and to this day, I am still of two minds about that. On the one hand, I am grateful to still be alive, and able to be here for my family. On the other – well, I hear the stories from my colleagues about that day (Thank God, they are all OK) and I feel guilty, because I wasn’t there. Survivors guilt. MY Family is safe, MY House is still standing, I am alive. My heart continues to be wrenched for those who were not so lucky.",

        "text": "I feel a little fraudulent writing this, overlapping my rather trivial experiences with those who felt the full force in 2010 and 2011. But the November 2016 quake is under-represented here, so here’s my memory, for what it’s worth. \nI knew something was brewing.  Since moving to the Wellington region from the UK I’ve been fascinated by quakes (a 3.5 makes front page news in England!) and remember my first rather exciting experience of feeling the house shudder and creak from a small quake up in Kapiti somewhere.  That got me interested in them and, much to my other half’s annoyance, I even started keeping a spreadsheet to record the local shakes.  But then I noticed, in the weeks before Kaikoura, that the shallow quakes in the Wellington region had stopped.  From 2-3 per week we had nearly 10 weeks without one….  And then I saw that we were due a supermoon and jumped to the conclusion that if nature needs a trigger the closest moon for 69 years might do it.\nOn the night of 13th November I watched the huge Moon rise and convinced myself that it looked almost sinister.  Our youngest was 18months old and had problems sleeping through the night, so I had taken to bunking down on a matress next to his cot so that I could do that rather pathetic dad act of half-heartedly shushing him back to sleep until his grumpily stomped in and mum took over!  My bad.  \nWe got to bed later than normal. Not long before midnight. Not long before the Moon was directly overhead… \nI was lying listening to the little guy breathing when I heard the rumble.  That dreadful, powerful bass noise that’s not quite a heavy truck or gust of wind noise but makes you question your hearing for a moment.  I must have listened for a few seconds before realising that it was the p-wave.  It sounded as if it was coming down the hill we live on and I instinctively leapt up from the floor with uncharacteristic speed.  Half way across the baby’s bedroom the rattling started.  70s window frames shaking, a gib wall vibrating.  The air was full of energy and unexpected sounds.  And by the door I stopped. Frozen.  Our large hall mirror was swinging wildly along the wall and, like an idiot, I just stood there and held it still. Why? Because it was a wedding present given to my deceased parents and it has some stupid sentimental value.  So I held on to the door frame with my left hand, braced against the wall and held the mirror.   While yelling “Earthquake!” \nFrom our bedroom my other half yelled “Yes I know it’s a bloody earthquake!”.  I didn’t realise it then but the 3 and 5 year olds had a few minutes before decided to bed hop in to the bed with her.  So she rode out the shake in a bed full of kids, huddling under the duvet.  On a bedframe that months before I’d promised myself I’d tighten up but had never got round to doing… \nAnd I left the baby in the cot.  I believed he was safe. He was asleep. He had wooden bars around him.  I’d squared that in my confused mind at some point.  The chipped, gilt mirror that I’d spent my teenage years straightening my school tie in front of was my prime focus.   It’s the little things like that that come back sometimes. \nThe shaking was deep and slow.  Like riding the Newhaven to Dieppe ferry in an autumn gale.  The house swayed and creaked alarmingly.  We have six kids and at some point I yelled to the three teenagers downstairs but heard no reply.  And then as the house dipped down again the quake suddenly stepped up a notch. A sudden violent acceleration that momentarily threw me off balance.  The same frequency but the wallowing motion became alarmingly deep. Those were the moments of fear.  Of helplessness.  I thought the house was going to fold up.  I braced to run and grab the baby, not knowing what to do after that if the building was about to collapse.  \nAnd just as suddenly as it started the quake passed.  \nOnly one little box had fallen over.  My quake prep had done it’s job and the furniture stayed upright.   The ceiling’s munted in the front room, split down a weak joint.  And there are cracks in a lot of places that need attention.  But we rode it out. \nWe let the baby sleep but the rest of us gathered on the sofa and talked it through. I nipped on a bottle of vodka.  My partner was shaking with anxiety and fear, and nearly a year later she’s still troubled with fears of a repeat experience.  Her senses are hightened to bumps and shakes.  She’s weaning herself off the geonet monitoring but feels even the small ones when she’s in bed.  She can’t sleep properly.  So I don’t because I’m now on alert to give her support when the next half decent shake happens.  \nThe kids show a range of reactions to the quakes now too but I encourage learning and rehearsing what to do in a quake rather than dwelling on the what ifs.  I like practical solutions to problems.  Having worked in forestry for a number of years I’ve had my fair share of hairy moments so I can’t say that I’m suffering from post-traumatic stress because, well,  I don’t feel it.  But I do feel a far greater need to protect my family and a massive responsibility for ensuring that we all know what to do when the next high intensity shake comes.  I’ve changed my route to and from work now, avoiding the CBD if I can and find myself planning escapes from tsunamis if I’m on the station in Wellington.   I don’t ever want to make a dumb split second decision in another shake and hold a mirror rather than a child.   We were lucky and dodged a bullet.  And we have to learn from it, not ignore it.\nMy heart goes out to those who lost loved ones and property in the 2010 and 2011 shakes.  I can only now appreciate the horrors that you’ve all been through and although my story is one of momentary fear in a northern suburb of Wellington I know that the 2016 event shook many people mentally far more than it did physically.",

        "text": "Mediation\nThe weather is turbulent.  A nor-wester shreds leaves off trees.  Cold southerly rain falls almost horizontally.  Another nor-west arch blazes with a red sunset.  A large golden moon rises slowly on a clear night and the air is still.  A few people are putting up fairy lights in their gardens.  At work Christmas carols are sung by a choir by a large festive Christmas tree.  \nTerry and I have a long weekend and head up to Nelson to see friends we have not seen for a decade.  Where has the time gone?  They are living in Wakefield, off a long gravel road, next to a river.  Most of their land is covenanted, so there is bush all around, and tui bouncing amongst the flax flowers.  We have the most amazing weather, and spend a day in Nelson.  Terry is taken out for a 10km walk along the boulder bank, and I wander through the Saturday markets and Suter Art Gallery.  It is so hot that we brave a quick dip in the river.  It is mightily cold!\nOn the Sunday we drive to Kahurangi National Park and walk up to the Flower Saddle and Mt Arthur Hut.   We see dracophyllum with their angular limbs, silver beech festooned with lichen, a rifleman with chicks entering a nest in a small hole in a tree, weka chicks, kakariki, kaka, tomtits and bellbirds.  It is a fabulous day.\nThe builders are back mid January.  The weeds have grown over a metre high – it is quite spectacular.  The builders spend the first week getting rid of rubbish and weeds.  The eaves are completed, almost half of the weatherboards have been replaced, and one quarter of the remaining removed.  Our new lounge bay window has been installed.\nOpposite our home, two neighbours character homes have been completely demolished, and they have already built the foundation, framed and put the weatherboards and windows in the home and garage.  Our progress is twice as slow by comparison.\nIt is very hot and windy, and it doesn’t get dark until about 10pm. The low cloud cover produces a very strange golden glow.  It pours with rain, and a huge double rainbow is intense in colour above us.  The front moves through, a broiling mass wave cloud which the sun lights a mandarin orange.  It is spectacular.  The large yellow moon hangs low in the sky, keeping the night bright.  It is difficult to sleep.\nFriends who took a cash settlement for their character home, and started building late last year are almost ready to move in.  They are having all of the normal problems with cash settlements.  Operating costs such as project management fees are not included, so builders project manage themselves.  When it gets to “practical completion” owners can move in, but this does not mean that the house is actually finished – it just means liveable.    There are small jobs to be done during a 2 month period that is tied to final payments (10%) and then a year for defects to be rectified.  Builders can make more money on other projects, so they say they will turn up, but don’t.  When you take time off work to be home for a tradesman who doesn’t show, it makes what should be an exciting time very stressful.  Still their home looks lovely. \nIt is Waitangi weekend and very hot.  Terry and I drive out to the mouth of Lake Ellesmere, then walk along the Hart Stream to a bird hide.  Across the water there are about 30 spoonbills loafing on the banks and on partly submerged trees.  Small brown trout cruise the stream.  It is very pleasant.  \nI prepare for our mediation meeting arranged by Breakthrough Services with our Loss Adjuster, Claims Manager and new Claims Manager.  It takes a long time.  I want to understand what their decision-making process is, and why our home was never a rebuild.  A friend says don’t get their backs up.  Fair enough, we can be civil.  Another friend says I should have a witness with me who can be impartial, as I will be stressed and may not hear everything important.  As our meeting is during my lunch break, I can’t think of anyone to invite.  I will have to go it alone.\nIt is very hot, then very cold and wet, then very hot.  On Wednesday 15th February, two fires start on the Port Hills, which form the southern backdrop of Christchurch City.  Firefighters felt confident they could keep the fire to the more unpopulated part of the southern side, but at midnight, wind changes transformed it into an uncontrollable inferno.  \nI stood within work mates on the 6th floor of our building watching in horror as the fire descended onto the northern foothills.  Helicopters carrying monsoon buckets were tiny specks in the enormous smoke cloud billowing above then and along the entire Port Hills.  We could smell the smoke even in the air conditioned filtered air of the office.  \nThe situation continued to spiral out of control with the death of a helicopter pilot who crashed near the summit of the Port Hills.  Hundreds of homes were evacuated, streets cordoned off, and schools closed.  The newly opened mountain bike park and newly restored Sign of the Kiwi were threatened by the flames.  At least eleven homes burned to cinders. \nPeople at work with homes in the Port Hills stayed home, some taking photographs of possessions in case they needed them for an insurance claim.  They stored important documents such as passports, birth certificates and insurance policies in locked drawers.  The fire raged for four days, affecting about 400 people.\nThe weekend came with cooler temperatures, the smoke cleared an 1800ha of burned ground, mainly pine forest on private land, was revealed.  Cloud lowered, but there was not enough drizzle to penetrate the soil where roots still burned.  It was going to take another 3 weeks to extinguish the last hot spot.\nIt is the sixth anniversary of the Canterbury earthquakes.  In the morning I go to mediation.  I ask how the decision was made between repair and rebuild.  The insurer accepts that they will spend $1.6 million (plus operating costs) repairing a property that is worth half that.  Our insurer will not address this, one of the underlying causes of our claim mismanagement.  The skill of our current Claims Manager is that she presents the arguments in a tone filled with compassion.  The way she frames her response hints that she has worked around internal policy to rectify some of the unfair costs falling to us.  She hints at being constrained by policy, but it is never clear if she means internal policy or our insurance policy.  \nThere is some discussion about “inside Policy” which I think is our Insurance Policy, and “outside Policy” which I think means internal Policy.  The confusion around how she explains this either shows that their internal management systems are unclear and/or her manager who is sitting next to me actually making the decisions is one of the causes of our mismanaged claim.  I get a hunch that he followed policy to the letter and forgot that there are always exceptions to the rule.   I think that he needed to come and see our home last year.  Making us a cash settlement offer that was realistic – we were offered 40% of our government valuation – would have solved a lot of problems. \nOur Claims Manager agrees with us that if our home had been declared a total loss due to earthquake repairs we would not be paying for some betterment and deferred maintenance. \nI ask why defective workmanship separate to the discharge of the insurer’s responsibility to restore the home as per the policy, fit for purpose and within reasonable time frames as required by the Fair Insurance Code and Consumers Guarantees Act. \nThe insurer says that our policy does not provide obligations to an insurer to restore the home but rather insurer’s obligation is to pay for the restoration of the home following damage caused by an insured peril. \nWhile this may be the case with some policies, this does not apply to ours.  Our policy puts our insurer in the drivers seat.  \nShe goes on to say that our policy does not extend to cover the liability of contractors for their workmanship.  I say that the insurer had indemnity for Builder 1’s defective workmanship due to a poor initial scope.  A proper scope would have identified structural damage in the subfloor and ceiling, as well as a leak in the roof which would have easily resulted in our home being a total loss.   To remedy, the insurer contracted Builder 2 and took full responsibility for the contract.  As the insurer has indemnity for Builder 2’s workmanship they must remedy his poor workmanship.  \nTo remedy, the insurer accepted indemnity for Builder 2 by writing the contract with Builder 3.  If the Insurer had no indemnity, they would have no say in our contract with Builder 3.  When we tried to change the contract, the Insurer threatened to walk away, re-confirming their indemnity.   In our case the Insurer was not simply a funder – they had legal obligations for indemnity.  \nOf course, our insurer will not discuss this.  When you are at an accident scene, you let the evidence do the talking, and never accept liability.  \nI say prove your position and provide objective evidence that our home was not a rebuild as if we had had good builders.  I suggest several ways of providing evidence.  The first is to select a number of repaired character homes similar to ours.  The second is to look at our costs and separate out defective work and correct work.  The third is to look at the 12 homes on TC3 land that are our immediate neighbours, all of which have been rebuilt.  \nUnder the Fair Insurance Code our insurer must provide objective evidence of their decision.  \nI do not want to create hostility or create a defensive stance.  What I wanted to do was to speak softly but carry a big stick.  I’m pretty sure that I have shown that I am prepared to step away from mitigation and have the evidence to take them to court.  \nI say that decisions to repair and rebuild have clouded the best reinstatement solution.  The Operations Manager looks very relieved and says emphatically yes, they have learned a lot from procedures since then.  This means there will be no insurance managed claims in the future, and we will have to check our re-insurance policy very carefully as to what it actually covers.  It will not include project management fees.\nI think about my next step.  I suspect lawyers will be involved.",

        "text": "Everything is OK, Mrs Duck is back……\n\nAfter several large and hundreds of small earthquakes, a ruined house, and many sleepless nights, it is good to reflect upon how many of us have handled this first introduction to a civil emergency. I think we passed the test, and whilst I would be loathe to go through it all again, at least I know that we were unphased by no water, electricity or sewerage, and that we can make a good fist of it.\nBefore the earthquake we had a lovely fish pond – very large fishpond actually more a lake, laden with gorgeous pink and white water lilies which were just beginning to poke up their heads out of the water.  Mr and Mrs Duck lived on the lake, and had been very very very busy making babies for weeks before the 4th September.   It was quite a sport watching them perform.  I felt rather pervy, but I simply couldn’t resist watching the ducks bobbing their heads in and out of the water in a lovely dance of courtship prior to the rather noisy, splashy and I must say, rather fast finale during which I was quite sure that Mrs Duck would not survive.  But survive she did every time, reappearing from her underwater position to fluff and preen herself elaborately.  We were waiting for the dear little ducklings to arrive but all they seemed to do was practice.\nOnce the 4th September arrived and the lake disappeared from sight, Mr and Mrs Duck had nowhere to go.  We assumed that they lost their brood.  They had no food, and were probably traumatised so they decided that we were the next best thing.  They paddled around the house looking for tidbits.  Mrs Duck was the brave one who knocked on the glass doors with her beak when we did not respond quickly enough.  \nThen after a while they disappeared as well, and we assumed they had met a terrible end.  The fantails disappeared also from all over Christchurch.\nThen last week, a joyous moment.  Mrs Duck appeared with 5 rather large teenage looking ducklings waddling around behind her.  She marched straight up to the door, and finding it open marched them right inside.  I assume she was proudly showing us her children.  Unfortunately the cat did not know this, and he shot out through his cat door – he was horizontal from the moment they entered the house.  He shot out, then in again, then out again.  \nThe cat door flapped and banged with each coming and going which frightened Mrs Duck who ushered her children back to the doorway and outside to safety.   Unfortunately she was unable to find the doorway but instead banged into the shut side of the glass door.\nAnd then she panicked.   \nShe tried again, but couldn’t get through.  The kids were calling and crying.  She became frantic, so she hammered at the glass.  Her webbed feet got wheel spin on the Italian marble tiles beneath her so she flapped her wings in an attempt to become airborne off this slippery floor.  Ducks and flying don’t exactly gel that well.  I guess the sheer fright produced a shower of duck poo which flew across the room, went underneath the glass table and stuck to the underside, flew across the floor and up the walls all aided by the flapping wings which helped to distribute it liberally around the room.  And then she found the gap and scarpered with her brood, never to be seen again.\nDuck poo is disgusting to clean up.  \nBut it was SO lovely to see her alive and thriving with her babes.  We wonder where Mr Duck was, but then he was never as brave as her, so he could easily have been watching her from afar, smirking.\nAnd the fantails are back.  So perhaps they all know something we do not.\nEverything is OK, I thought, Mrs Duck is back.",

I’m sure they have foreshortened all our lifespans – 80 year old father is convinced he is going to die, as I write.  The September one happened 6 weeks after we moved into our house in Aranui.  My cats ran out the cat door, there was roar, and then lots of shaking.  But there wasn’t much damage that time, and we got water after 5 days, so that was no big deal for our family – an adventure, really.\nFebruary 22 was altogether more sinister – for many families, even more so than ours.  I had had an unpleasant meeting with an unpleasant person that morning.  She zapped the energy out of me so much that I didn’t go to town like I planned.  I wish I had, and then I’d be dead now, and not living this nightmare.  This Feb earthquake felt like we were in a washing machine, and yet the house only got surface cracks – I wish it had been a write-off so we didn’t have to live in it.  Lots of vases, crockery, plates, the toilet and the gate were broken.  My father was at the Avondale Golf Course, and got flung onto the ground – that is why he is so sick now.  We had no water for 23 days and no power for 12 days, and felt abandoned.\nMy health (I am 44) has gone badly downhill, so I can no longer cope with this property.  The trouble is, we are orange zoned, and worried it will stay that way for many months, even over a year, according to the latest news reports.  If it is green, it could be unsellable – I wish we could go into the red zone so we can buy a nice little unit near shops and things – in the Sydenham region, where we used to be.  I can not escape this hell, as I part-own this place (which has become my nightmare) with my parents.  No accommodation supplement, no nothing.  I’d like to know who will help me with my shopping and this unruly section,and protect me from the ferals around here, as our nice neighbours had to move out, due to their houses being badly damaged.  The authorities have only seen my parents.\nAs I said, I wish I’d died on Feb 22.  If that sounds wicked, too bad.  Incidentally, why isn’t June 13 counted as an earthquake – we had liquefaction then, and 10 new potholes in our street.  Which is why I was gobsmacked when we were only made orange.

        "text": "It feels longer than six years since the February 2011 events, but to this day I still feel quite tearful thinking about it, I am as I type these words.  I find it hard to express how this has affected me to those who were not there but could talk for hours to those who were.  I remember thinking as I went to bed the night before, things are starting to feel a little normal again.  The September 2010 events had really hit the Canterbury region hard but no one had been killed, so we were all very grateful.\nThat day had felt different, the weather felt different and the sky even looked different.  At the time I was working for the Christchurch City Council and worked with Civil Defence and the building inspectors as they went from door to door to the worst affected suburbs affected by the September 2010 events, assessing residential buildings.  I worked as Welfare personnel, tasked with assessing people within their homes and what their needs were.  I cried with people on many occasions with people after I asked how they were and they gave me an honest answer.  \nThe week before the February 2011 events I had been able to return to my normal position within the Council and I was really excited about that.  As I have already mentioned, the night before I thought “…this is good, it feels like we are getting back to normal”.  That was the last night we slept in that house and it was for many, many other people.  I can’t describe the absolute panic I felt when I finally got to school to be greeted by children sitting in the playground waiting for their parents, crying, hysterical and the teachers looking a bit similar.  \nI thank God every day that I was not in the central city that morning, any other morning I would have been.  I don’t know if I could have walked past people without helping them.  A colleague of mine from work had done just that and it cost him his life, he was the first person to be identified because of our identification cards.  From school I started to head towards town to get to my parent’s house and we were caught up in traffic for hours.  Every radio station you tuned into was not operating, having been replaced by Civil Defence instead.  I really started to panic as I changed each radio station and the same message was being replayed on each station.  \nWe were in Hagley Park for a long time when we could smell smoke, it seemed like a lot of smoke at the time.  All of a sudden there were large numbers of people walking through Hagley Park towards us, having abandoned their cars, they walked.  People abandoned their cars everywhere, just wanting to get home, make sure their loved ones were ok and walking was truly the fastest way.  The emergency sirens were deafening, both from a distance and close up, they were everywhere.  And the Civil Defence earthquake siren, it still makes my legs turn to jelly when I hear it.    \nAftershock after aftershock, the ground just didn’t seem to stop.  I remember being stationary in traffic right next to the Carlton Hotel on the corner of Bealey Avenue and Victoria Street and there was a large aftershock and many bricks came down onto the street, from both the Carlton Hotel, the Knox Church and the Victoria Street buildings, leaving huge dust clouds.  It was terrifying and surreal all at the same time, unbelievable.  We were all in tears by now, tears of complete shock and disbelief as we looked around us, devastation and panic, fear and helplessness on everyone’s faces we could see.\nWe drove through so much liquefaction, my engine started to smoke and I was sure the car was going to blow up, but it didn’t and eventually we got to my house which was like everyone else’s homes, a complete disaster site with everything everywhere and it was literally split in two.  We then managed to get to my parents a few hours later in the traffic and spent the night with them in the only safe part of their house, the addition out the back.  \nI started smoking again that night but I have since stopped.  It helped and I don’t care that that was what did help.  Wine helped too.  To this day, I carry in my heart the memory of that day as if it was still happening before me.  It is hard to imagine a worse day.  My heart goes out to those who have been so terribly affected by the Kaikoura earthquakes and the recent fires in the Christchurch Port Hills.

Attached is a photograph of one of the paintings, which was recently on show in a Wellington art gallery. I bought this painting because in it I see very strong associations with the Canterbury earthquakes.\nAs a consulting engineer specialising in earthquake engineering, I was a member of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission following the earthquake of 4 September 2010. Immediately following the devastating earthquake on 22 February 2011 I spent several weeks in Christchurch helping to lead teams of structural engineers who were assessing tall damaged buildings and devising ways of stabilising them. These buildings included the Hotel Grand Chancellor, the Copthorne Hotel on Durham St and the Government Life Building. This ‘Critical Buildings Team’ appraised over 40 buildings of six or more storeys.\nA few days into this activity, I learnt that Christchurch artist, Marie Le Lievre, had many of her paintings trapped in the Government Life Building and that some of her colleagues similarly had left important works behind in their terrifying rush to escape. By coincidence, on that same day, the building owner came to the Critical Buildings Team office in the Christchurch Art Gallery.\nOn hearing of Marie’s concern, the owner immediately promised to contact her if and when an opportunity arose to rescue the paintings. His genuine concern and willingness to help were most impressive, given that he was the owner of several major buildings in the CBD that had been seriously damaged.\nIt was several months before the paintings could be rescued, but Philip Carter kept in touch with Marie and the other artists so they could be present when the opportunity finally came to recover the works. Marie, who is my niece, was in the photograph published in the Press on 19 May.\nTo my earthquake-centric mind the two groups of circles in the painting resemble shaking intensity maps which are used by seismologists and engineers to describe the effects of earthquakes. The right hand group of circles represents the Darfield earthquake of 4 September 2010 and the left hand group represents the Lyttelton aftershock of 22 February 2011. It is as though this part of Canterbury is being viewed from above and from the north.\nThe overall darkness of the colours speaks of the huge overall impact of the earthquakes on Christchurch and Canterbury. It was a dark day for many. The dark brown and black colours represent the widespread liquefaction that caused severe damage to buildings and infrastructure, and disrupted so many lives. These colours link the two groups as a reminder that liquefaction occurred not only in these two earthquakes but in many aftershocks.\nThe light brown colour and shapes between the two ‘targets’ are reminiscent of the Port Hills. This calls to mind the landslips and rock falls that caused such extensive damage to homes and sections – and forced many people and families to move elsewhere.\nThe inclusion of red at the centre and throughout the left ‘target’ is a reminder that 185 people died in the Lyttelton aftershock and that many more were injured.\nThe light background tells of the positive spirit of the people of Canterbury and the fact that even the huge devastation and disruption caused will not dampen it. As if to emphasise this Canterbury spirit, there are alternating red and black colours in the left group of circles.\nFor me, the painting is also a reminder of the incredible contribution of engineers and building officials in response to the 22 February earthquake. They dropped what they were doing and came from far and wide to assess thousands of buildings that had been damaged all over Canterbury in a matter of seconds. The commitment, courage and skills shown by these professionals were simply outstanding. It was a rare privilege to be part of such an effort.\nMoving Target is a fitting name. The target is Christchurch City and Canterbury which have been shaken by thousands of aftershocks since 4 September 2010. The epicentres of these aftershocks have varied widely in their location. Plotted on a map they look like moving targets. The many people who have been forced to move within or beyond of Canterbury as a result of the earthquakes may well consider themselves as moving targets.\nOverall, the painting provides a reminder of the worst of destruction and disruption that the earthquakes have brought, and of the best of human responses in the days, weeks, months and years that have followed.\n18 February 2014\nExamples of shaking intensity maps (from GeoNet)\n\n\nMagnitude 6.3, Tuesday, February 22 2011 at 12:51 pm (NZDT), 10 km south-east of Christchurch.\n\n\nMagnitude 7.1, Saturday, September 4 2010 at 4:35 am (NZST), 40 km west of Christchurch.\nMoving Target\n\nPainting by Marie LeLievre\n\nFinalist James Wallace Awards 2010\n\nExhibited at The Pah Homestead Auckland and Dowse Gallery Wellington\n\nSold by Bartley and Company Wellington to David Hopkins May 2012\n\nNote: The background of original painting is very light blue, not white as it appears in this image.

        "text": "KIA KAHA, CHRISTCHURCH\nTuesday February 22, 12.51pm\nForget all the disaster movies you’ve ever seen. People don’t panic and scream when something very bad happens. They do that when they spill milk on a freshly washed floor. Or when the dog digs another hole under the fence. Or if the car won’t start when they are running late. Small calamities of this kind can make us lose control, make us yell and cry and spit the dummy. When something very bad happens people gather their wits. \nAt 12.51pm on Tuesday, February 22, 2011, a terrible thing started to happen to Christchurch. After the first earthquake, on 4th September, 2010, I declared that I wouldn’t want to be in a shopping mall should another one strike – but there I was, in a mall. Worse, I was upstairs, in a movie theatre, watching “The King’s Speech” with a friend and a number of other people old enough to be in a theatre in the middle of a weekday. The screen went blank, and our world cracked and roared, bucked and swayed, and our city began to fall down and apart. We could only fling out a hand, clutch an arm rest, call out, exclaim, gasp, wait …\nThe people, however, did not fall apart. Not the ones I saw anyway. When, an eternal twenty seconds later, the rocking and the noise stopped, there was silence in the theatre. Miraculously, the lights came on. We could hear the whooping of the emergency siren.  For a few moments no one moved. No one screamed. Then slowly, one by one and two by two, we rose and walked without haste down the stairs. We spoke in short, whispered phrases, to each other and to strangers: perhaps “are you OK?” as we passed someone hesitating.\nOutside in the foyer mall staff were already directing evacuation. There was rubble, debris. Again no one ran or screamed, although we saw one middle aged woman being comforted by a friend. B. and I, along with streams of other people, walked out to the landing and found ourselves at the second level of the car park. Cars were already on the move, edging through pedestrians. We went down some stairs but at the bottom we found the gate locked so had to go back up. \nWe walked down the UP ramp of the car park, through the mall where staff were urging people to keep away from the buildings. There was glass everywhere.  Cars bumping and nudging. Over all the other noises the whoops of the emergency siren kept up its urgent message. \nOutside we crossed the road, stopping the traffic splashing through water by lifting an imperious palm. B and I started walking towards her house, and by the time we had gone a block the water – dense as a chocolate thick-shake – was ankle deep. I took off my shoes and squelched onwards, unable to see what I was stepping on or in. The earth had cracked open and there were holes and fissures everywhere. We passed a damp yellow labrador which smiled at us from a tiny patch of dry pavement and I hoped it had a home to go to.\nAnother block and the water was reaching our knees, gushing out in geysers and flowing along the streets, whirl-pooling around holes and spurting over humps and hills. There were now people everywhere, leaning over crumbled walls, standing dismayed in their cracked and lumpy gardens. Are you OK? What’s happened to your place? OMG, look at that! Neighbours huddled with neighbours, called out to us as we stumbled on and we stopped briefly each time in sympathy. There was mud, bricks and debris but no tears or panic.\nOne more street – but we couldn’t cross, there was too much angry, boiling water. Over there, on the other side, there was an elderly Chinese man with a Zimmer frame trying to cross but he couldn’t either, at first. But somehow he made it into the road and, ramming the Zimmer frame in front of him, he stuck his chin out and marched resolutely along the middle of the road where it was relatively shallow, ignoring the cars splashing slowly past on either side of him. Bravo, I thought.\nWe eventually found a place to cross where the water, instead of swirling, simply flowed. Clearly there was nothing disturbing it beneath the surface. My car, parked in the street outside B’s house, was belly-deep in water, and an hour later when I briefly contemplated driving home, the water had turned to mud. The car was stuck fast.\nWhen we reached it the house was a mess. The chimney had snapped off but was still lying on the roof.  Every cupboard in the place was open with its contents strewn and broken all over the floor, bookcases had tipped their loads off, the pictures were still hanging on the walls but seriously askew. There was, of course, no power or water, although they found an old-fashioned plug-in phone to use. R was manfully trying to clear up but the task was heart-breaking.  \nI wondered about the state of my own house but there seemed no chance that I was going to be able to find out any time soon. My son got through on my mobile eventually, and told me to stay put until further orders.  My car wasn’t going anywhere, even if I had been brave enough to start the journey home.  B made up the spare bed and triumphantly produced a new toothbrush.\nStrong aftershocks continued to rock the house all afternoon. The only news we got was through the transistor radio but what we heard was awful: the city was badly damaged – again – and all services were out. J, having left work about 2.30pm, was still in her car, creeping dangerously and scarily along with everyone else, and didn’t get home until six hours later. The roads were cracked and bulging, flooded, and full of sinkholes – some big enough to swallow cars which were falling into them and having to be abandoned.\nS managed to reach me and we drove with difficulty to my house. When we reached it, the house was a mess with everything overturned and scattered, the power and water were off, and the section was flooded with both water and silt – the phenomenon that we had only recently come to know as liquefaction. The house had moved backwards, forwards and sideways, so that there were gaps all round between house and garden. Inside there was a mess with shelves and drawers emptied out all over the floor. Amazingly the television set had managed to stay on its base and there were a few glasses and items of crockery broken, but otherwise it looked as though I had come off lightly.\nClearly the house was not the place for me to be, on my own, for the foreseeable future. We decided to escape to the bach on the West Coast – but what to do about my three cats?  The neighbours were caring people who had helped me out before and they gladly agreed to do so again. I gave them a key and told them to help themselves to whatever they needed from my house.\nWe stumbled about with the small torch and packed a bag with a few clothes. I also picked up the address book, some fruit, cheese and fruit juice, my medications, and even remembered to collect the tin containing the valuables. My key-ring already held a memory stick with the contents of my computer’s hard drive. A life can be reduced to such necessities when disaster strikes. \nSo the three of us went through the dark, wet, dangerous streets now littered with abandoned cars.  As we drove carefully westwards we came to an intersection – and there were traffic lights. And soon afterwards there were houses with lights showing.  And street lights. The roads were clear and seemed undamaged, although we were still in Christchurch. The quake had, this time, hit the eastern suburbs and, as we found out later, with a force that was far more damaging than that of four months earlier.  That quake, at magnitude 7.3, was greater, but it was deeper underground, and centred in a rural area 25 kilometres outside Christchurch.  This one, at magnitude 6.3, was right underneath and only 5 kilometres deep. The already damaged city was too vulnerable and the damage was shocking.\nWe were feeling a little guilty about leaving.  On the one hand, we could do nothing and we would be three fewer people potentially needing help. On the other hand we were leaving my neighbours to cope with my responsibilities – three cats – for who knows how long. S and J were in a rental house, more or less camping, but they were in limbo – planning to move into a house of their own on a large section near the city centre that very weekend. They had paid a deposit on the deal but the formalities had not been completed – and there were now changed circumstances that could affect the transfer of the property.  In addition, the banks, accountants and solicitors whose services were needed were no longer available to consult.\nFrom Moana we watched on television as events unfolded on the other side of the Alps. We saw how our city was suffering but also how the people heroically rallied round, both on a large scale and at a neighbourhood level. Whole communities banded together to cook and share meals, look out for and support each other. A crowd of people in Rangiora started a food supply operation with donated ingredients and delivered hot meals by helicopter to the eastern suburbs, from morning to night every day.  \nThe earthquake co-ordination centre was based at the Christchurch Art Gallery – a modern building with a frontage that is more or less a wavy glass curtain.  The gallery was built only a few years ago, and one of its purposes was specifically to act as an emergency civil defence centre, and it is a constant source of amazement now that this amazing structure that should be a heap of broken glass has (so far at least) withstood the tremendous shocks under which the rest of the city was crumbling. The television cameras were permanently set up on the forecourt and any announcements and media briefings were made from there.\nUniversity students set up a website to offer help of any kind to anyone, and for people to volunteer their services. The Student Volunteer Army (SVA) mobilised – again – to march out with shovels and wheelbarrows to clear away the silt for those unable to do it themselves. They mobilised after the 4th September quake and we became used to seeing cheerful, energetic bands of young men and women putting their backs into the many tasks that needed to be done.  \nAs well, the SVA applied their energies and organising abilities to many of the other community tasks that need to be done around the city, from helping old ladies, handing out information pamphlets, fetching water, digging out vehicles. You name it, they did it. They had a website and a telephone help line for both those in need and those who could help, and they proved themselves to be a fine bunch of young people who earned the respect and admiration of all.\nThe whole of Christchurch – indeed the whole country and much of the world – did what it could. Farmers hitched water tanks to utes and drove through the streets offering water to any who needed it. Neighbours helped to dig latrines in back yards and fired up barbecues to share sausages and goodwill. Mobile coffee shops drove around supplying free coffee. Strangers turned up and turned to, like the woman who stopped her car when she saw a woman shovelling silt. The driver got out and so did her four children. They collected spades from the boot and all five of them spent the next two hours scooping the grey wet sand into the road for the trucks to collect. Then they drove away, to find someone else to help\nHowever, there were a few despicable scumbags. Each morning, in the regular briefings from the art gallery, there were reports of the overnight looters and others trying to take advantage of other people’s misfortunes.  Not many, but those who were caught were left in no doubt of the contempt of everybody from the judiciary down.  In one notorious suburb the SVA shovelled silt watched by a crowd of residents sitting on walls and fences, smoking and laughing. \nThe whole country rallied round.  Personnel from Navy ships, docked at Lyttelton when the first quake hit, cooked hundreds of meals every day and delivered them to welfare centres. The ship Canterbury went back and forth to Wellington replenishing supplies and equipment of all kinds. The Navy also set up a desalination plant to provide clean water especially for the eastern suburbs – hardest hit this time round. They were delighted to be able to test the process because they hadn’t, so far, had the opportunity to do so in a real emergency. \nFrom Moana S and J made a day trip back to Christchurch to deal with urgent matters. They took with them some supplies that we had bought in Greymouth the day before for my neighbours: long-life milk, milk powder, cat food, candles, paper towels and batteries. When they returned to Moana in the evening they were able to tell me what they had seen and heard.  \nTheir rented house had sustained minor damage and there was no water, power or sewerage connection. They confirmed that the deck of my house was leaning, and had no power, water or sewerage connection. I was moved to tears to hear that the neighbours, and their friends, had gone in and cleaned up the silt that had covered my garden and garage floor, and even gone through the house lifting up the furniture, cleaning out the fridge and freezer, putting books back on the shelves and leaving all tidy.  They even straightened the pictures on the walls.  \nOn Tuesday 1st March, at 12.51pm, one week from the disaster, the country stood for two minutes silence. All over the world expatriate Kiwis were doing the same. Here the cameras were trained on the view down Worcester Street from the Art Gallery to The Square, where the broken cathedral stood as it had for well over a century.  On the gallery forecourt there was a simple cairn of broken bricks, masonry and a living frond of green fern – symbols of a city’s hurt and also of hope.\nThe statue of John Robert Godley, one of Christchurch’s founders, which had stood in The Square for a century or so, had, ever since the first terrible shake, been lying prone where it had fallen off its plinth. Some days later someone noticed that there was a cavity in the plinth, and within the cavity there were two time capsules.  One was a hand-written letter in a glass container, which had shattered, and the other was a sealed canister. These items were carefully retrieved and sent to the experts at the Canterbury Museum for examination.  \nMuch later\nOn Friday 18th March, 2011, a memorial service was held in Hagley Park, attended by Prince William, many dignitaries, and several thousand people on the grass in the bright sunshine. It was a most moving occasion – I confess to several unashamed tears as I watched video of devastation and heard tributes and stirring words. Music too – Dame Malvina Major, Dave Dobbyn. Hayley Westenra among others.\nMy house still stands, but it is cracked and mis-shapen. It is to be demolished and re-built, maybe this year if I am lucky. There have been more than 14,000 quakes since the first one on 4th September, 2010. \nA Maori phrase has become popular since the earthquakes: kia kaha!  Meaning “be strong”. Christchurch people have shown themselves to be strong, and resilient, and compassionate in spite of terrible events. They have been tireless in their efforts to help themselves and each other. They have kept their sense of humour. They are standing strong. \nKia kaha, Christchurch!",

        "text": "I was working as a Store Manager at Eastgate Mall, in a alternate gift ware store (I had been employed in this role for the past 8 years and ironically it was my anniversary that week of employment).\nMy staff had joined me at 12pm and we had spent considerable time serving an elderly customer I was just about to leave for lunch when the violent shaking began…almost instantly I grabbed my staff member and we held each other tight, I remember starting to shake uncontrollably with fear but had to get everyone out as I was the manager.\nI saw the glass shelves fly with all the stock and then the lights went out followed by loud crashing noises and I felt an excruciating pain all down my left leg losing all balance, my staff tried to hold me up but I said help the others get out  at that point I went nauseous and thought I was going to die, it was a split second thing.\nWe both crawled over broken stock and rubble (I had to drag my leg as there was no feeling apart from pain and it was wet…from bleeding) we crawled to were the elderly customer was and tried to pull her up, her face was covered in blood and she was whimpering. I could see a couple (man and woman) who were also in the shop trying to get up while groaning in pain…I was at this point shaking violently and couldn’t move. I was panicking as another woman was at the side of the door that wasn’t moving and I screamed for help…she started to rouse and blood was streaming down her face to and she began to sob.\nA security guard got through the damaged entrance to the shop and started to help out the other customers who were also screaming and crying. I couldn’t stand without help, so my staff and the guard were on either side of me. We had to climb over all the broken stock but wouldn’t leave until we were the last out… but I was also I was terrified to move as all the shop structure had collapsed (learnt later that it was the weight of the car park and caved into the mall).\nIt was an eerie sight as we finally got out of the shop into the mall…people who I knew running past screaming with blood covered faces and bodies or covered in dust, there were parts of the sky light swinging and liquefaction and sewage already seeping through the interior on the floor.\nI had never seen it before and at first it totally freaked me out as it was traveling quickly but as we reached the main entrance I saw the big pillars of the car park swaying and screamed to get out faster…but the sight I saw in the car park will be forever etched in my mind, it was like in a war movie.\nBecause I had worked in the Mall for a long time I knew most if not all the staff from all the businesses that worked at Eastgate and to see them all in such states of distress was horrific in itself, there were some lying on the ground in state of shock,  shaking violently, two were having epileptic fits, many had blood on their faces (that’s why I am amazed at the media report that only 6 people were injured at Eastgate Mall) some were vomiting…a young mother cradling her baby rocking with blood on her face.\nThe last paragraph was seen by me in a flash and at the time what with the pain in my leg and in a state of shock myself, I started to go dizzy and nauseous and past out falling to the ground…I could hear people saying “wake up ” my staff member had gone out of my sight and as I came to… I screamed for her.and I was lifted to me feet again, the head of security came to me and hugged me and then started to sob…we both did, I looked around and saw my husband running towards me, just as the second (or third) after shock hit…the car park started to sway again and everyone was screaming, many fell to the ground including myself and staff, my husband got us to the car.\nWe shouted to the crowd if anyone wanted a lift but everyone seemed transfixed so we made our way out of the car park…hated having to leave customers and Mall staff as we drove past all in shock but knew we all had to get out and I needed my leg and now my shoulder, head and back from collapsing, seeing to.\nThe roads were literally erupting before us with burst water and sewage mains spewing deluge all over the roads…the traffic was just unbelievable, we came through an intersection bumper to bumper when suddenly we were hit by another car going at ridiculous speed at such a time, the impact spun our car 180  hitting the right side passengers door… again I thought we were going to die as I saw vividly the look of sheer terror as our car almost plunged into an oncoming lane of traffic (mothers getting their kids from school) it was just awful.\nMy husband managed to control the car…only one man and his daughters stopped to help as everyone was in their own state of panic to get home or to loved ones. \nWe eventually arrived home and again the destruction there was too much, I lost that day the use of my leg and foot, my job, our house, our car and a lifestyle we enjoyed… but know we are lucky to have survived and our heartfelt thoughts go to family and friends of those that didn’t",

Now 15th June.\n\nAll night we seemed to wobble and then a pretty long and big jolt again to get us up at 6.27am.  This feeling of not knowing what to do prevails, the enormity of the events in the scheme of the earth’s energies and evolutions.  How strange to be living in this, being onlookers and participants in this earth led change.\nEach day we eagerly devour our local paper to find out any new information.  There are a lot of us in this together.  The weather continues to deliver a gorgeous and mild winter.  Next week will be the shortest day.  We are blessed with this mildness during such disruption to our own living conditions.\n Son Mischa called me this morning.  He was back in Avonside at his home, worse hit than ever; sitting in a sea of liquefaction again and he unable to even enter the house or the shed this time.  The gate to the property and all doors jammed as the earth has moved and dropped so much.  “How do we go forward?”  That is the question asked by most of us each day.  Those with monetary resources at least have more choices.  The “haves” and the “have nots”, and the distance between them, is enhanced and worsened by these disasters.\nNelson June 17th 2011- \n\nTime away again briefly to reflect on the week and deal again from outside the shaking zone, with Telecom, EQC and Insurance. I work to get communications open, lines connected again at the house, computers sorted due to power surges, review where things are at with EQC, once more doing battle, whilst all the while conscious, they are still wobbling in Christchurch.  Fifty five springs have erupted in the Heathcote Valley yesterday, yet Maria who lives there, tells me many of the neighbours still have no water in their taps.  She has been doing loads of washing again for some of the neighbours and comforting distressed people.  This time people have tried to get back to work and to school more quickly but people are demoralised, there is a huge heaviness reflected in their faces, their voices, their words.  It is hard to find the positive this time.  \nJune 18th – Wellington\n\nLast night I spent the evening with Ross and Moira. Ross has the commission to do the official photographic record of the demise of Christchurch since September 2010. His photo story is amazing and shocking especially the latest lot, from the visit this week post June 13th.\nI sat last night and listened as he described his afternoon of the 17th in Sumner and Redcliffs and Ferrymead and Phillipstown.  Now I was in the position of being the person asking and listening, trying to understand, having not been in the zone for 3 days.  He described some jolts and rock falls again quite close to where he was photographing, and distressed people trying to retrieve belongings and pack cars. It’s hard to believe it is ongoing, yet ongoing it is.  That great lull in early June was a fake lull.  And of course it is full moon time again.  It can be laughed at but actually it is a fact that for the past 10 months now we have had significant jolt periods around the time of the full moon and I am not a Mr Moon follower!.\n20th June – \n\nWho says money can’t buy happiness.  I certainly feel a lot happier now, than I did a few days ago, and time out from the quake zone has done this for me and the caring of other people. And clean sheets and nice bed linen and warm air temperatures and no shaking.  It benefits us to get away.  It always does but once again we are separated into those who can arrange or find a way to get a break, and those who can’t.\n21st –\n\nAnd I am heading back to Christchurch.  Today I have had that horrible heavy feeling in my body and fluffy feeling in my mind, unable to cope with what lies ahead.  Today I made contact with the council again and the Geotech firm, and Telecom.  Hopefully tomorrow I will see some movement and resolution in some of these quarters.  What I do know is that what is next is fast approaching, and requiring answers.  By Friday I need to have alternative accommodation, or it’s back to the caravan and I can’t do that, health wise.  The lungs are in revolt.\nGovernors Bay June 22nd 3.45 am and 7.00 am\n\nWe are jolted awake yet again.  A truly horrible night starting with a 5.3 jolt centred (we are told at first on Geonet) nearby in the heart of the Peninsula.  10.34 pm and I had just got settled in to friends Sarah and Philips.  I had not yet unpacked my bag but was enjoying a meal and a glass of wine sitting around the fire with  another visitor for the night, Sam.\nDiary entry\n\nThe night has been peppered with quite severe and noisy jolts.  It is extremely disturbing, my stomach is churning and I feel sick and anxious, my heart rate increasing with each significant jolt.\nLui the dog is very disturbed, pacing the floor, settling down on the end of the bed, then pacing again.  He is on high alert.  I spent yesterday worrying about how I would be, coming back, and now here I am and it is worse even than I feared.  The strength of these shakes is disturbing and the relentlessness of the hits even more so.  I spoke to my son Mischa yesterday and he reminded me of the hope again as he spoke of the plans small business owners had to move into Sydenham, the revival of the fashion and café scene of High street in a new locality.  He talked of his ideas to open a café or specialty food outlet.  His enthusiasm was contagious and I found myself being carried along by the excitement of it.  But now at 4.00 am and it does not feel exciting or positive. It seems unbelievable.\n\n4.30 am now and we’ve had a lull for half an hour.  Time to go up to the kitchen and meet Sarah for a hug and a hot lemon and honey and a look on Geonet to see the number and size of quakes, and then a quick talk to husband and son as they prepare to leave for a morning meeting in Vancouver.  I struggle seeking sympathy from them and they struggle to understand what is happening here, and yet they are obviously concerned.  I wonder how the houses are doing, all the broken houses and roads and the people all over Christchurch.  How will they fare in a night like this?.  Just looked on Canterbury Quake Live and have seen the locations and number and the sizes of the shocks.  They are coming from all angles, the hits.  Some are on the old fault out west and an equal number on the eastern faults out to sea.  We have had four over 4.0 in the last five hours.\n\nI am sick of measuring my life like this. \nWhen I look at the news reports on TV and see the sad and stressed people in the liquefaction areas to the east, I cannot believe what these people are having to cope with on a daily basis.  They are just waiting – waiting to be told if their land is to be remediated or not.  Everyone is just hanging out for those decisions, and then what? They can’t all be relocated at once so how does it change the actual living conditions?  It doesn’t, it just gives some closure to the not knowing and gives people an idea to hang on to of what might be next.\nThis morning I will visit our house and see how it has fared over the last 7-8 days. I will try to get some sleep in this calm patch.  \nAnd I did sleep for three and a half hours and then up and off to our house.  It had fared well although there was mess again to clean up.  The temporary strengthening carried out on the house has protected it from further decay!\n11.00pm 22nd June – and so to sleep.\n\nA day of upset stressed out people as we faced our work days after little sleep.  Tomorrow is the first of the announcements about houses that will not be saved and land that will not be remediated.  I am hoping our son and daughter-in-law will be in that first batch and how much their payouts will be and when they will all get them.  How will the other many thousands feel tomorrow who are not in the initial packages, yet whose land and houses lie in ruins.  So much stress today so obvious in people’s faces and behaviours, yet the mechanics of everyday life turn over.\nNight of the 23rd – almost midnight.\n\nTonight will be the last night in the comfy inside bed at Sarah and Phillips.  Tomorrow night Mark will return from his work trip overseas and it will be back to the caravan.  Mark will not be pleased.  Its real winter now and raining outside.\nToday brought relief and sadness and reality to all those marked in the red zone.  My son and daughter-in-laws house is inside this zone and my granddaughter looked at me on the way home from school and said, “Ganga, I love my house though and what will happen to the playhouse in the garden and to my tree house?”  It is such a strange thing for thousands of people in this zone to say goodbye to their homes, some of whom have been in them for fifty plus years, to leave their streets, their communities behind and go who knows where.  There is relief and sadness mixed.\nAll over town people gathered around their radios at 1.30pm as the Prime Minister John Key outlined the outcome of the findings and the Government’s offer unprecedented, all unprecedented.  But what of the people left stranded one street over from the demarcated line or in some cases, one house away.  We see as they are interviewed the fear and emotion on their faces.  They feel left out in the cold, just one step away.  Who will ever want to buy their properties?  What will they look out on for years but a large scale demolition of what had been their neighbour’s properties?  I feel for those people demarcated orange or green and then what about the rest, the white zones.  Not even worked out yet.  What is to be done with them, the hill zones, cliff top homes to the east and south east in the harbour, with land still crumbling, so difficult to assess.  High value properties and land commanding gorgeous views of Christchurch and the mountains and the long sweep of the Bay to the Kaikoura mountains in the background.  Such sought after suburbs and now in many cases, places of terror and unknown precariousness.\nThey and us in the inner harbour, we have been allotted innocuous “white” and wait.\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

        "text": "It was 10.30am on February 22nd and I was in the CTV Building in central Christchurch, with my 6 month old son, visiting the osteopath and friend, Janet Meller.   Janet worked at The Clinic on the 4th floor.  I didn’t like the CTV building.  We had been there the week before and it felt really wobbly; every time the big crane moved in the adjacent section the CTV building swayed. I even commented to Janet that the building must get  a “bit of a rock on during an earthquake”.  Little did I know that a giant earthquake would hit that lunchtime and the CTV building would crumble into a pile of rubble before the shaking stopped.\nA couple of hours later, after an early lunch with an old friend and my baby was sleeping in his car seat as I drove home.  Suddenly the steering on the car started to swerve wildly and I honestly thought one of the wheels had fallen off.  In the next few seconds all I could think of was how on earth was I going to explain this to my husband.  I could hear the conversation in my mind “...honestly honey, I was just driving along and the wheel fell off…” He simply wouldn’t believe me.  Then I turned the corner and watched our local church collapse. It was amazing to watch, it was as if the building had just melted as the bricks crumbled and fell to the ground.  I realised at once it was an earthquake. I found myself driving home along the edge of the Heathcote River, guiding the car over liquefaction as it was happening.  \nHaving come through the September earthquake relatively unscathed I was not prepared for what greeted me when I got home to our house on the Hill. I opened my front door and saw total devastation.  Everything we owned seemed to be on the floor, lying broken and smashed. My husband called to see if we were OK and I told him to come home because the house was wrecked.  I will always remember his three word reply “Are you sure?”.  When he got home he saw the awful destruction for himself.\nWe stayed with the neighbours that night.  Their house was in a similar state to ours but we decided there was safely in numbers.  We didn’t want to be alone. Our family of three slept in a double bed in their spare room.  It is a night I will remember forever, much worse than September.  Aftershocks relentlessly rolled in every few minutes.  In the silence of the city without power we could hear each one coming; a deep rumble followed by the shaking less than a second later. We had very little sleep.  \nThe next morning me and my baby left my husband behind and bolted my parents’ home, the endless aftershocks were too much for me.  We had almost a full tank of gas, which was good and petrol was running low since everybody was trying to leave the city at once.   I arrived to find my sister and her family had done the same thing.  It made for a very full house and that night I shared a single bed with my baby.  It was at my parents, that I saw the TV for the first time since the quake and I realised the devastation in the city and the saw the pile of rubble that had been the CTV Building.\nBut, I was very unhappy without my husband.  The following day I returned to the city to pick him up and we headed out together, as a family, to stay with friends in Leeston.  Over the next few weeks we moved around from Leeston to Golden Bay, then Motueka and back to Leeston. Finally 5 weeks later an engineering report confirmed our home on the hill was structurally sound and safe to live in.  We headed home to a still shaking Christchurch. \nThe hardest thing to come to terms with has been that I unknowingly took my baby into danger.  I knew as I stood in the CTV building that it wasn’t right.  It was unusually wobbly, but I did nothing about it.  I trusted the experts and assumed that they would have closed the building if it was unsafe.  I do wonder, if I had said something to the right people, would it have changed anything?  So many people died that day, many of them in the building I had been in that morning.  I still struggle with the thought that had the earthquake struck earlier that morning…",

        "text": "I am 28 years old. I have been involved in several vehicle collisions, fallen off a cliff, been lost in the bush and faced a few bushfires … but on 22 February was the first time in my life I felt dread and feared for my life.\nI moved from Canberra Australia to Christchurch New Zealand in January, just six weeks before 22 February. The 7.1 quake of 4 September did not deter us from moving here. I’d never been to New Zealand but my partner had three times, and the photos of the snow-covered mountains and beautiful beech forests were enough for me to know I would love it here.\nIn those six weeks after moving here I got a good taste of the aftershocks in our third storey office on the corner of Lichfield and Madras as well as one I experienced on the 16th storey of the Hotel Grand Chancellor where I stayed the first three nights.\nIt was a novel experience having the building rattle several times a day. My heart would skip a beat for the larger aftershocks but I didn’t feel I was in danger. It was even fun.\nHow naive was I.\nI was on my lunch break on 22 February. I had just left Hanafins Pharmacy and was walking down the tram tracks on Cashel Mall to buy lunch at The Crossing food court when it hit.\nThe noise was like rocks being rattled around in a metal wheelbarrow but a hundred times louder as brick facades started swaying out and then slapped back against their frames. The ground bucked and heaved, rippling and breaking under the immense force of the quake. The entire front of a shop near me collapsed and a tangle of metal and bricks crashed to the ground. Bricks were being hurled through the air from both sides of the Mall and I just stayed there on the tram tracks, knees bent, looking up and around just trying to stay on my feet and avoid the bricks. There was screaming, people trying to stagger to the relative safety of the middle of the Mall.\nI turned around and looked east and saw the Westpac building swaying dangerously in an arc. Buildings aren’t meant to do that! They’re meant to be solid! It was a nightmare. It didn’t make sense. I feared for my life, expecting to die as the city was shaken to pieces around me. I was just a small and fragile pawn caught up in a maelstrom of a scale beyond anything I could influence. There was nothing I could do.\nIt was all over in 15 seconds, or at least the main quake. Felt like longer, but then again time did seem to slow down as cortisol flooded my system. I saw a cloud of dust billowing out from the east end of Cashel Street and I immediately thought of footage of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers.\nI stood there stunned for a few moments, taking in the destruction around me, people crying and hugging each other, some clutching at bleeding head wounds. I grabbed my phone and tried to call my partner but the lines were already jammed. I managed to get a text to her and found out she was alive and unharmed in our apartment in Merivale. My next thought was for my colleagues at work, so I ran … partly to get there as soon as I could in case they needed help, but also to spend the least amount of time in the shadow of the tall buildings. Those 15 seconds had changed my perception of buildings – they just didn’t seem as sturdy or safe any more.\nCashel Street had cracked down the middle and water was gushing out all over the road. I leapt over the river and through the thinning cloud of dust that I later found out was from the CTV building. My team were all standing out on the street, one of them had been hit in the head by a cable tray that fell from the ceiling but was otherwise ok.\nAfter checking in with my team my next priority was to get home to be with my girl. I tried taking the shortest route diagonally across the CBD to Merivale but after trying to make a few inroads down Cashel Street and Hereford Street I gave up on that and headed north along Madras, walking down the middle of the road and avoiding tall buildings as people and cars slowly streamed out of the city.\nI had nothing on me but my wallet, phone and the medication I had just purchased from the pharmacy on High Street. I wanted to toss it away – it felt so stupid to be carrying around something so useless and insignificant with such devastation around me, but I didn’t.\nAfter crossing Armagh Street I was safe from the tall buildings and gas leaks but by then the liquefaction had really kicked in and was mixing with sewerage from ruptured pipes. The roads and footpaths were all cracked and jutting up, walls and garages on a lean. I tried again to start heading west but was confounded by the brown smelly rivers of sewerage and rising grey flood of silt. A few people were getting offered lifts in cars but I wanted to stay on my own two feet … especially having seen half a dozen men standing on top of a compacted car just moments before, trying to pry the doors open.\nI ran as much as I could but I eventually succumbed to the concrete dust that coated my throat and lungs and had to slow to a walk. My roundabout route back to Merivale from work took about 4 kilometres and I arrived back home exhausted but on an adrenaline high. Our apartment on Carlton Mill Road seemed ok apart from a few chunks of concrete missing and a collapsed free-standing wall in the front court but how can you tell if a building is safe? I had just seen several buildings destroyed by the quake, dozens of people killed … how could you know?\nWe sat at the bus stop across the road and held each other. We eventually had to make a decision to go back into the apartment to get some supplies including food and water before evacuating to Little Hagley Park away from all buildings. I ran in and grabbed the supplies as well as a bottle of whisky and we went and sat in the park. I despaired as the 5.9 quake hit. It felt like the ground was being torn apart. I wanted to be on the other side of the planet, far away from this madness.\nWe made our way down to where a crowd was gathering in Hagley Park but they had no clue. We waited. Eventually some guy came and told us about an evacuation centre down near the gardens. We went down there for a couple of hours and sat on a plywood board but nothing was happening and we decided we’d be better off doing our own thing so we walked back home.\nAnd that was my experience of 22 February. We stayed the night in our apartment and slept in our clothes sitting on the couch but the following day someone suggested it wasn’t safe. They were right. A week later our apartment was red carded. We stayed with friends out in Kainga for the next two weeks till we found a new place to live.\nWe were fortunate. As renters we didn’t have to worry about insurance claims. We hardly lost any property. We were still alive and unharmed. I think people remember those who died and forget those who still live but are scarred for life. Dozens of amputees, the victims of horrible crush injuries. People who still suffer with the emotional trauma of such a terrible event, who jump every time a truck rolls by. Even I get twitchy when I hear a wheelie bin rumbling down someone’s driveway.\nI’m grateful that I was in Christchurch on 22 February. It was one of those events that makes you take stock of your life and re-think what you’re doing. Am I making the most of the time I have? Am I doing what truly makes me happy? Could I be doing something more? At the very least, I went and did a first aid course so I could be of more use if such a thing happened again and I am making more of an effort to appreciate the time I have. I go out hiking more often and try not to let minor frustrations bring me down. Just remembering the day of the quake helps put such things in perspective.\nI survived 22 February. I know hundreds of other people in the CBD did too – but many didn’t.\nI am fortunate.",

        "text": "I’ve lived in in Christchurch for most of my adult life and only twice in that time have I run to my children’s bedside during the night, in an earthquake. A few years ago now, those tiny ripples were pathetic compared to what I was yet to experience. A light sleeper, I was out of bed like a shot on that morning of Sept 4th, but I didn’t make it past my bedroom doorway, the shaking was so violent. I stood in the doorway and wondered why the roof-tiles were breaking. \nIt turns out you can think of a lot in forty seconds. Standing in that doorway I had enough time to remember there were chimneys up there and realised they were in the process of crashing down into the roof.  I had enough time to calculate my chances of making it across the hallway to my children’s bedroom without being smeared across the floor under a chimney verses staying where I was, under a rimu doorframe, 1.5 metres from a falling chimney. \nWith my husband in Melbourne for a few days, I decided to stay where I was – I wouldn’t be much use to my kids laying under the other chimney outside their bedroom door. I had enough time to think this must be the Alpine fault rupturing, and it must be terrible indeed in Greymouth. I had enough time to think that at this moment everyone in Christchurch must be doing exactly the same thing as me – cowering, terrified in the dark. It occurred to me that there was a small, but significant chance the house would fall down, killing me, and I would never see my kids again. \nStanding there in the dark as the house continued to shake furiously, I clung to the doorframe and looked down at the floor I couldn’t see and felt despair. I had enough time to realise I’d never felt despair before. I had enough time to hate myself for despairing – for just standing there doing nothing and accepting possible death. I had enough time to realise one literally does hang one’s head with despair. A body going limp as hope drains away. \nWhen the shaking miraculously stopped, it occurred to me that the shaking hadn’t gone on very long considering the Alpine fault ran for hundreds of kilometres along the length of the South Island. A small seed of doubt crept in then, my assurance it was the Alpine fault and the relief I felt that it had finally ruptured was already being eroded. It took a microsecond to think these final thoughts before I shot across the hall to my children’s bedroom. A couple of days later I noticed a small finger sized bruise on my youngest child’s upper arm. It was from my firm grip around her arm as I dragged her out of her bed and across a fallen bookcase to the relative safety of the doorway. \nLater I realised I didn’t just stand in the doorway doing nothing, and I didn’t need to hate myself. I did all a reasonable person could do – I held on to a rimu doorframe for dear life and wished I could be with my kids. That is all a reasonable person can do in the terrifying darkness of a 7.1 magnitude earthquake.",

        "text": "A Mother’s Story… It was Tuesday 22 Feb 2011, I had just gone out to get the mail and while out there I picked a beautiful rose for Bronte. I was happy to bring a lovely rose for my gal. Once back inside I sat down in the dining room and I heard that all too familiar noise of an impending earthquake but this time it was very loud. Bronte was in the lounge, so I grabbed her and chucked her under our dining table (a strong rimu one) and then it all started. I heard the bricks fall off my house, the lounge ceiling came down, all the kitchen things fell out, all the treasures in the rimu cabinet fell out and my poodle Bonnie was crying, as she was locked in the hallway. Then I heard screaming and crying. And the hot water cylinder burst so I had a river of water running through the house. It felt like the house was rocking back and forward like a ruler being flicked – the intensity was incredible. It was absolutely terrifying. Somehow in that moment I managed to get through to my husband on the mobile and said :”it’s bad, come now” and then the line cut out.\nFor about two hours Bronte and I lay huddled together under this table. Bronte was remarkably calm – she said “it’s an earthquake mamma”. But she was obviously shocked as she went to sleep and those who know my Bronte girl, know that she is NOT one to sleep during the day haha. I felt that if we moved we may risk our lives, so we stayed cuddling under the table. Eventually Peter arrived home – he was my hero – he made it to us. As the Ferrymead bridge was out he left his car at Ferrymead and ran home. He was shocked at what he saw. I screamed to him to turn the water off at the mains to stop the river of water thru my house.\nAt this stage it was OMG – we could finally assess the damage – wow – the house – our home was a wreck. It honestly looked like a bomb had hit it.\nOur power was out, our water was out but luckily we had many supplies of food and fresh water. Fortunately we were well prepared. All the phone lines were out and the mobile network was overloaded, so we could not contact anyone.\nTogether Peter and I tag teamed to get the emergency supplies out. Got the emergency bags out, put a radio on. The key thing during this time was to keep Bronte safe, so she spent the next few days living under the strong table.\nOur kitchen was covered in about 2 feet of stuff – revolting – a mix of soiled food, spilt alcohol, spilt water and broken things – lots of them. We spent ALL of Wednesday cleaning up this toxic and dangerous mess. When it’s on the floor you realise just how many wine glasses you actually own, lol.\nWe could finally catch our breath and realised that without facilities eg power, water, sewerage and with the house so dangerous that it was time to leave, so we took up my lovely friend Lynn’s offer to stay at her home.  Bronte said to me “I got a brick mum”, as she pulled a brick off the wall of our house.  This was the catalyst to finally leave…  \nTrying to evacuate our home was a nightmare – one that I never hope to have to repeat.  Arriving at Lynn’s felt like a surreal experience. It was like coming from a war zone to the Hilton of Avonhead. It had been survival at a very basic level.  We spent four days in the house before we finally had enough and left.\nOur wee dog Bonnie is with us at Lynn’s but our cat Sky is at home which breaks my heart. We are leaving food out for her but she is seriously spooked and she won’t come when we call her.  Very upsetting.\nBronte is doing really well here at Lynn’s. She said: “it was scary” but really she seems great. I am so pleased to report that there are no nightmares this time. But her physical health is a wreck, so day by day I am trying to nurse her back to health.\nI have been very shook up about what a close call Bronte had with her life. If I had not grabbed her and chucked her under the table I think my precious wee girl would be no longer but somehow a miracle happened and she survived. One minute later and she would have been squashed by the lounge ceiling.\nOne major concern for us is our land damage and whether we will be safe to go back to our home. Need to see EQC geotech engineers to know about this. It seems that the house has stood up reasonably still which is amazing but we do have a lot more damage this time, including some pretty meaty structural damage. It is just a matter of waiting.\nMy heart goes out to everyone who has lost their family or friends. And my heart is with ALL my lovely friends who have lost their homes. As I lived in Mt Pleasant most of my friends lived in that eastern area, so most of my friends are out their homes. My heart is with you and I am so glad that you are ALL safe and alive.\nThanks to all my lovely family and friends for ALL your amazing offers. And a huge thanks to Lynn J, Sam J and Matt J for so willingly having us live in their lovely home. We are blessed to have such good friends and family to support us.\nStill feel shattered. But know that I am so blessed to have my husband Peter, and my precious daughter Bronte. We are not sure what the future holds but we have got to have faith…..\nIMPORTANT – on a side note – I am on a campaign to get everyone to have an EMERGENCY survival kit – pls do this – pls do not regret not doing this. Pls help share this message.\nUpdate at August 2011\n\nOur home, land and driveway has approximately $400,000-$500,000 worth of damage.  It is incredible just how munted our home and community actually are, but for me it comes back to having faith.  Faith that in time the earthquakes will stop, faith that in time our home will be repaired or rebuilt and faith in ourselves that we will get through this challenging journey.  PS:   Our cat Sky turned up and continues to live a cruisey life of bliss.",

        "text": "THE TALE OF THE CONE\nHi there, I’m Quentin, I’m a road cone. You know, one of the orange-and-white markers that stand around guarding the road-works areas. According to some of our friends, we’re the “carrot-coloured pointy-headed hobbits.” My full name is Quentin Cohn and my story is about Quakes, which is short for earthquakes, but what other kinds of quakes are there? \nI didn’t know of quakes at all until I was rudely awakened before dawn one September morning. There were dozens of us Cohn family members all stacked together in a big shed belonging to City Care, when everything started rocking and rumbling and rattling and tumbling, and didn’t seem ever to stop. Cohns swayed and toppled, some rocked and rolled out under the door, and one of the oldest members – who had spent time on the West Coast – cried: “Wake up, adventure is upon us!” Us young ones, of course, were wide-awake already.\nWithin an hour two men had arrived with torches and started to load us onto a big truck. Not just ten or twenty, but dozens all at once. The truck had a special swinging-arm device for setting cones down onto roads. The truck and men travelled slowly in the morning gloom and listened to radio reports about damaged houses and dangerous roads. Soon they were depositing Cohns around watery holes that had suddenly appeared in the middle of city streets. Before long we arrived at a road that followed the river. Men in uniform were setting up roadblocks, preventing traffic from crossing a bridge or turning left – it looked as if the bridge had been pushed up half a metre too high, and the road to the left had a big gaping fissure across it. We turned right, obviously, and the swinging arm started seizing Cohn after Cohn and plonking down a line of us in the middle of the road to block off the left side, which had slumped down weirdly towards the river. When my turn came, I guess I was about number twenty out of a hundred in the line. That was my first adventure.\nAs the sun rose to a beautiful spring morning, I realised I was standing on the white line in the middle of Avonside Drive. Near me was a hole in the road full of water, it was so dangerous that someone had put a rubbish bin in it to warn cars. Not far away, a willow tree which was leaning over much too far towards the river. Looking away from the river, I could see a house that had lost its chimney, and gained a pile of red bricks in the drive. Beside the house, the drive seemed also to have sprung a leak: gray sandy water was bubbling up from cracks in the concrete and flowing out into the gutter. Some of it oozed across to where I was standing. It didn’t smell very nice.\nThe people in the house were awake and active. They set about trying to release their car from its garage. This meant removing the bricks from the drive, shovelling the silt away, putting old boards across the worst cracks, and wielding a crowbar to open the garage door which had twisted and jammed. All the time they had a transistor radio blasting the news of major event: “Quake measuring 7.1. Extensive liquefaction in low-lying areas. Damage to houses, bridges, sewers, power supply, and hundreds of roads.”\nBefore the day ended I had my second adventure. Men with hard hats and clipboards came walking along the street, staring into one hole after another, and muttering to themselves. Then the original truck returned with its swinging arm and whisked us all up. That’s when we gave it a nickname – the whisky truck. But why so soon? Because that particular road was being closed to all traffic, and we were needed elsewhere.\nThey bumped us along a few undulating streets to a road-works site. I was one of a dozen set down beside a hole that drainage workers had opened in the road. We were there to assist a flashing-orange sign that was guarding the work-site overnight. The cars had to slow down to pass through the narrow lane of roadway remaining. But the cyclists didn’t all slow down, and I saw one of them come a cropper because he suddenly hit a pothole that hadn’t been marked. He picked himself up, and would you believe, he picked me up too –just lifted me from my assigned spot and placed me beside the pothole. Then I saw it was nearly half a metre deep, more like a sinkhole!\nThere I stood all night, happily enough. A few cars and trucks came by, but I was not hit or even nudged, unlike one of my friends nearby who was somehow knocked over – in the morning I saw him lying down helpless and vulnerable. It was OK, though. For one thing, we’re designed to not hurt the cars that hit us. For another thing, he was righted by a man who came out from a house to grab his morning newspaper. “Ah,” said the man, “chaos there may be, but the Press has arrived before seven!\nBy that time the workmen were starting to appear. They left me by the sinkhole for the meantime. In practice that meant patiently standing and guarding till six at night, when a different truck came with stones and tar and patched up the sinkhole. It was just a quick repair to stop bikes from tripping over. Then instead of dropping me by my friends they took me on their truck to their tar depot. What a smelly place that was!\nThat tar-truck turned out to be my base for the next few weeks. I knew there were hundreds of holes in roads. What surprised me and everyone else was the number of little quakes that kept happening: dozens of them, often easy to feel, sometimes strong enough to shudder open more potholes and widen the existing cracks in roadways. The truck-men were kept busy for 10-12 hours per day, and I was one of their six friendly Cohns, that they set down every time they did a patching job. Often we formed a phalanx to block off a lane of traffic for half an hour before moving elsewhere; seldom did we stay more than a week in the same spot. One of the big guys even talked to us when man-handling us into the truck: “Up you go one more time, fellahs!”\nDuring those weeks I travelled around much of the city. We did patching in the busy arterial roads, and then the smaller inner-city streets. The continuing quakes never came close to knocking me over, but the high winds of October and November succeeded several times, especially when I had not been set down truly vertical. As for the rainy days, they caused little hardship, except when three of us were standing in a hollow of the road and got our bases flooded by dirty water.\nIn December the six of us were reintegrated into a bigger group of Cohns: one of the major roads which I had previously helped to patch was now receiving a more serious rebuild. While work was done on the north side of the roadway, the south side had to be divided into westbound and eastbound lanes. And that was our job: there were two hundred of us all in one stretch of road, lined up with cars going on either side of us, sometimes going too fast for comfort, too fast for the narrow lanes. One of the Cohns even got knocked over by a van which hit him in the big reflector and crumpled him. But that left him in everybody’s way, so a truck-driver stopped to straighten him up and return him to the line.\nOn the second day of this, I was put in a prominent position and given a silly hat with a “keep left” arrow on. For a while I was proud to be first in the line; but actually the hat was uncomfortable, and then it proved a handicap – it helped the nor-west wind to blow me over and roll me into a ditch. Fortunately I wasn’t really needed: it was obvious to sensible drivers where their lane was.\nLater in December I found myself in a quiet suburban street. Cohns were needed there to guard holes, but little work was being done. While we did our business in the street, we saw portaloos doing their business on the footpath, or rather helping people to do their business, if you know what I mean. Anyway, that’s where some children started playing with us. First they put some green foliage around my shoulders, where my upper reflector is; then they linked five of us together with little wires, all connected to a little solar panel: we were being used for fairy lights, like the Xmas lights on the veranda of their house. And then a little boy came and said: “You’re the one!” I was the one who got to wear the red Santa hat! \nA burst of work was suddenly done, before the Xmas break, and at the end of one long day the road was fully opened again. I was stripped of my silly hat and lights, and we were loaded onto a truck to take to storage. The quakes seemed to have stopped. Perhaps my adventures were ending?\nOh no! On Boxing Day we all felt a sudden sharp jolt, as if we’d been punched from underneath. We knew we would be back in service soon. This time it proved to be the inner city, a district of tall buildings, some of which were considered unsafe. Twenty of us were lined up in front of a three-storey office block, so as to stop people passing too close, and soon a huge truck came to assist in this task. It deposited not fences or flashing barriers but an enormous metal shipping-container. Even a drunk driver would avoid that. Our job then was reduced to defining the lanes of traffic. \nIn that worthy if boring role we stayed for nearly two months. I learnt a bit more about inner-city issues and building inspections and insurance assessments and engineering reports, but mostly I just stood sleepily in the road.\nThen it hit us, near the middle of a February day. First a brief rumble, then a huge jolt. That quake bumped me from underneath, and jumped me up into the air as if my weight had been suddenly switched off, then it dropped me down on my side. I heard rattling sounds, and a loud crash which was the parapet of a nearby building toppling onto some parked cars, and then screams of people running out of buildings and shops, and then sirens coming from ambulances or fire engines (I was too low down to see which). For two hours there was frenzied activity of vehicles and people trying to negotiate the rubble on the street, and then there was a weird silence: the inner city had been cordoned off to everyone except emergency teams. It took all night for the dust to settle.\nThe people who had shops or jobs or flats in that inner-city street were now forbidden to enter. I saw some army men rumble past in a light armoured vehicle and station themselves in the distance, at the edge of the cordon. Mostly the emergency teams were busy elsewhere, trying to rescue people from damaged buildings, and cope with more little quakes every few hours. It was some days before they checked the buildings near me, not finding anyone killed or injured. It was a week before the damaged cars were towed away. Soon after that we were carted away too, to a part of the city I didn’t know at all.\nAlthough that nasty quake did the most damage among the tall buildings of the inner city, it had been centred near the hillside suburbs. There were places where rocks had rolled onto houses, or houses had fallen off cliffs, or cliffs with houses on top were threatening to crumble and to cause damage below. Hundreds of Cohns, hundreds of shipping-containers had been placed under cliffs to keep people away. And my group, transferred from service in the city, had to help protect the public during special operations on the cliffs. In a spot where a major road runs under a cliff, I could see men dangling from ropes on the cliff-face, dislodging suspect rocks and making them fall – making them fall not when the next random quake struck but sooner, in a controlled way. I could see some rubble that had already fallen from the cliffs, and even a bit of a house. One time the men closed the road completely for an hour and a loose chunk of cliff was dislodged, showering us with dust. But mostly we were part of the controlled conditions, helping to narrow the road to one lane and helping to assist the traffic-management guys with their stop/go signs. Over some five days, I saw a lot more bits of cliff come down safely. But how would the men know when the job was completed? I didn’t get to answer that question, because they arranged for a paint-truck to replace my line of cones with a double yellow line.\nAfter that adventure I was assigned to the traffic-control team assisting the drainage workers. It seemed that a coherent plan had been devised to solve the shallow underground problems caused by the deep underground ones: the seismic activity.  The biggest shallow problem was old sewers that had broken and needed replacing. Dozens of us lined up to guard the big holes that the big machines had to dig, sometimes we saw big long plastic pipes being fed into the ground, and periodically we were moved further along the road as the work progressed. In June, as the winter was beginning, I was stationed opposite a park where tall trees were waving in the nor-east breeze. One day I saw a stormy sou-wester strip the final leaves from an oak-tree. \nThe quakes kept coming, with two sizeable ones in June, but then they became smaller and fewer. The next big natural event was not seismic at all, it was snow. And that gave me a winter adventure. Snow came, even to this city by the sea. It laid a white carpet on the road where I was stationed, it covered the dusty suburb with newness, and it delayed the work of the men with the diggers. And it delighted the children. Some of them made a big snowman in the park, with a tall pointy hat. And guess what, the big pointy hat was one of my Cohn brothers. They grabbed me too, for another purpose. They had found a narrow hole beside the footpath, and they poked me into it, point downwards. Then they made a big snowball and put it on top. The result was possibly the world’s first big Ice-Cream Cohn! They even took a photo of it. It looks a bit like an ordinary ice-cream being licked by a funny little man. But actually the man is normal-sized, and the Cohn is yours truly, Quentin!\nThe road-digging efforts tailed off too, and by September – a year after the first quake – many Cohns were taken back to the storage shed where I had started. But many were still needed, since hundreds of streets had not been properly repaired. I was one of those guarding road holes in a low-lying suburb where fewer and fewer people were living. Near me was a concrete-block wall with a few blocks missing – that left a zigzag pattern as if it was trying to be a staircase.\nBy December half the houses were empty, and two days before Xmas two new quakes wet my feet with dirty water. That’s when more people left, and not just for summer holidays, they left for good taking all their belongings. I was placed to mark a little depression in the roadway, barely two centimetres deep at first, but it got slowly deeper as tremors kept coming from passing trucks or from underneath. \nBy mid-February only two families remained at my end of the street. And they were preparing to commemorate the day of the worst quake. It was the anniversary of that nasty jumping quake that had brought down big buildings and killed 185 people.  The day before 22 February, I saw an eight-year-old girl gathering flowers from her dry tidy garden and the overgrown gardens of her neighbours’ abandoned homes. As soon as her left arm was full of flowers, she came out to the little group of Cohns on the road. “Here’s a blue one for you!” she said, and placed an agapanthus in the hole on top of my head. “It’s for grief and remembrance.”",

        "text": "Feb 22nd:\n\nI had been in the Riccarton Mall Whitcoulls trying to spend a gift voucher while they’re still honouring them. I gave up, had to get back to work. So I left the mall via a corridor which took me out into ground-floor parking. Another level of the mall and at least one level of parking above me. 50m ahead the exit and beyond that my car, parked on a surface street. I’d taken a few steps in that direction when the shaking started. I made inarticulate noises while I tried to work out what to do. I was very conscious of tonnes of concrete above me. \nThe shaking was so bad I hugged a large concrete pillar nearby while I thought “what should I do?” “where do I go where a pocket might form if this all comes down?”. There was the doorway I’d come through behind me, but it had large glass doors so I think I subconciously dismissed it. I felt a quite helpless because I really couldn’t think of a way out of the situation. But then the shaking stopped and I sprinted for the exit. It seemed to take a long time to reach daylight and the footpath.\nNot a lot of people at that exit and only a few cars. I heard someone in a parking level above yelling “get out”. Everybody trying their cells, including me.\nI drove back to work, there was some milling around, exchanging stories etc. Got a text from a co-worker of Kathy’s saying she was OK and heading home. So I shut down and did the same. Bumper-to-bumper traffic both ways on Birmingham drive. Moved maybe 5 car lengths in the first 15 minutes. Listening to the radio, trying my cell, exchanging nods and grimaces with people crawling past me going the other way. After the first 30mins or so, still on Birmingham Dr, started to think about just parking and walking home (google says 9.5km, 2hrs by foot). But I didn’t. Very glad that the lights were working at Blenheim Rd. Most were, but a few were out, people being very careful at the uncontrolled intersections. A couple of guys in hi-viz directing Curletts/Yalhurst. Several strong aftershocks while on the road, including one while stuck near the Waimari/Grahams Rd roundabout with huge trees beside me, thinking, are they going to go?\nOccasional attempts to call out. Got through to my parents. My father had gone around to our house and done a basic check and reported it was OK. That was a relief, I feared returning to a broken house. Called home a few times and it just rang and rang — a sign the power was out. Didn’t get through to Kathy until about 3:30.\nFinally made it home. Kathy shortly after. Went round to my parents, who had power, and watched the coverage on TV until dusk when we went home and read by our emergency torches.",

Not that I had a great many plans for the day… get up, open some presents that had been sent by friends and relations from overseas… maybe head to the tennis club and play a few games of tennis… nothing special. I live alone, have no family here so it wasn’t really going to be that special a day. \nBut it WAS still my birthday…\nSo what I wasn’t expecting, when I went to bed the night before, was to start my ‘special day’ by being literally tossed out of bed in the wee small hours of the morning…\nAt first my confused, half conscious mind thought that there was a freight train coming towards me. Then I rationalised that no, I lived nowhere near the rail line. Then I thought maybe it was a jet coming down on top of me… then, as I looked at the radio alarm just as the numbers on the face winked out it occurred to me that, what I was experiencing was my very first earthquake. And it was a bloody big one.\nOf course, all this occurred within a very few seconds but it seemed like a lifetime. I live alone, it was pitched dark, I couldn’t see the books that were literally being flung off my book shelf like missiles but I sure could feel them. I could hear banging and crashing and smashing and it really felt like the world was ending…\nThen after what seemed like forever, the shaking stopped and there was  silence.  I think that was more scary actually… the silence and the blackness that followed. \nBut of course then came the aftershocks. Had never been in an earthquake before but I knew they’d come. 99 on that first day… I counted.\n99 earthquakes on my birthday. And a LOT of clearing up to do. Helluva present…\nOnce the electrics came on I wasn’t getting phone calls and e-mails from family and friends wishing me Happy Birthday, it was frantic messages wanting to know that I was ok… which of course I was. Well, a little ‘shook up’ maybe. Like the rest of Canterbury’s residents.\nIt was a miracle no one died… and we all knew we had dodged the proverbial bullet when we heard the magnitude. The same as Haiti that had killed tens of thousands…\nSo yeah, that was the best birthday gift I could have gotten. The fact that no one died. \nWho knew that just a few months later we’d be hit by an even worse shake  on Feb 22nd.\nI am sure that was someone else’s birthday in Christchurch… and they weren’t as lucky as me… \nIts been a tough year in a broken city with so much uncertainty and as I approach my 39th birthday in three weeks, I wonder what this next year will bring… who knows? Maybe it’s good that we can’t look ahead and see what’s around the corner.\nOne thing I do know though.  I am lucky. I still have my health, my home… I am still here to have another birthday. 181 people are not…\nAnd I guess that puts it all into perspective.",

        "text": "All day Monday the 21st Feb, I had a weird feeling of dread, like something was going to happen.  I tried to ignore it though!!  On the 22nd I was relief teaching in Rolleston and at 12.51 we were having mat time with the kids and could feel what we thought was just an aftershock spread from one end of the centre to the other.  The other teacher and I looked at each other and she mouthed ‘shit, that was big!!’  The kids were amazing and kept pretty but one poor wee girl headed straight under a table and was really distressed. \nWe simply thought it had been a fairly strong aftershock but then starting getting texts from friends and family in the City. My sister in Auckland texted me saying ‘6.3!!  Are you ok?’  I got really scared then…  Then I started hearing that buildings had come down and people were dead.  By this stage, all the staff were really upset and you could feel the panic as we all tried to contact our loved ones… I asked if I could go home early and left as quickly as I could.\nListening to the radio was really devastating as I was hearing the most horrendous stories and just started crying.  I didn’t know what I would find when I got back to my house.\nStopped and bought a bottle of wine and arrived home yelling to my neighbours to see if they were ok.  Crying and crying and things were all over my floor.  Turned on the TV and the pictures were just unreal to me.  I could not believe it.  At that point the biggest aftershock happened and I flew under the table screaming ‘STOP, STOP, STOP!’   I was so scared that I might have lost friends or family and was shaking so hard.  I headed round to friends and the rest of the day/night is a bit of a blur… just lots of crying and sadness.",

And I was not only standing there, I was pushing the door jambs apart and I was standing there thinking “ I hope this is what I am supposed to do, it hasn’t changed, has it?’ \nThe three or four days after the main earthquake my whole body quiverred, as if I was on a boat. \nI had this queasy feeling constantly, and completely no concentration… I ‘d pick up a book and I’d only read half a page and get up and do something else. \nWe spend a lot of time down at the Lyttelton Info Centre, I couldn’t put my mind to any of my proper work jobs other than what had to be done.  The info centre was a drop-in centre where anybody could go. You could just turn up and talk to people or you could feel like you were doing something by baking some scones and taking them down there, – so you felt as if you were helping out, but part of it was ‘I want to be with other people’... you weren’t quite sure whether you were the giver or receiver.  \nI think I thought quite a bit  about how fortunate we were that we had no deaths. We compared it to Haiti, where they had the same strength earthquake and so much damage and so many people dying and still suffering from it. There was even a bit of guilt that we survived it so well. \nMy brother rang me from Brisbane. He never rings me. I have been in New Zealand for 35 years and had maybe one phone call from him and that was before he came to visit me 30 years ago. So this was quite out of the blue that he rang. So he was ringing to see how I was after the earthquake and he had just been to Japan and he said  “I know what you feel like, ‘cause I have been to a simulator while I was there and I experienced a 7. ” and I said – I had just looked on geo net,  “We just have had 344 aftershocks!” I just couldn’t let it go.  And he said “Oh, have you? Oh!- Gosh!” \nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton .

Just as I was going from my house into the garage I felt a big shake and after experiencing the first one I knew that we were going to be in for another earthquake. I slammed the door closed and went back into my living room and felt the whole house shaking. It was scary. When the house stopped shaking I looked out of the windows to see if there was any damage in the area and saw all the liquifaction spewing up out of the ground. Then when I tried to get out of my house all the doors were jammed because of the ceiling coming down and blocking the doors. As I was trying to get out I saw two girls running after their dog so I banged on the window loudly and called out for help, to get me out! The girls forgot about the dog and came up my drive and forced a door open to enable me to get out. They said before the roads get flooded we are all meeting on the corner. I went down to the corner and stopped there on a wall waiting for other neighbours to come, but because the roads were flooded only one made it.

Diary entries following 22 Feb 2011\nSandy Bay, Governors Bay, Tuesday 22nd February, a beautiful morning with fog decorating the harbour early, and lifting to sun and warm temperatures.  \n\nAnd our world was to change forever.\nI can still feel the violence of that shaking, the attack on my whole being as I was thrown to the floor of the sitting room, earth bricks, books, paintings and ornaments crashing around me.  I can hear my long guttural screams, only pausing to take a breath before the next one begins.  And I can hear my housekeeper’s screams from the upstairs landing, matching mine, filling the gaps where mine ended and hers began.\nThe world as we knew it was ending.  My loved ones, her loved ones, where were they, how were they faring this time around?\nThe horror of September 4th we could not imagine could have been repeated in our lifetime and yet this was not a nightmare – it was real. I could smell the burning wool and see the iron lying now face down on the carpet, thrown from the board where the ironing was recently being done.\nI tried to get up, to move away, but it was impossible.  The floor was throwing me upwards. Thrust by the viciousness of invisible enraged forces emanating upwards from the earth, this benign place, now the site of rage from an unseen beast.  I think of the grandchildren and their seeking of reassurances from their grandmother.\n“Is the earth asleep today, Granny?” (Grace, 5 years).\n“Ganga, please stop the ground moving.” (Inaki, 4 years)\nAnd the months of slowly gaining normality, hoping we had managed the worst after September 4th, and that we were heading towards better things.  Now that hope was over. \nOur home, the oasis of warmth and richness of colour and life, now catapulted into utter confusion and destruction.\nWhat has happened to those I love?  They are all in the city that day; they cannot all have survived this.    \nAnd then it is quiet.  I get up and find my way through the chaos to the patio under the grapes outside.  I can hear voices across the Bay.  I call, “help me.” I am not physically hurt but I am psychologically.  The voices call back, “Rosie, are you okay?”  I am ashamed of my calling, yet also happy to hear human response in the Bay and to have the reassurance and warmth of people arriving.  First a man I have never seen before or after, with an English accent.  He appeared and we hugged and then he disappeared. And then a neighbour, looking so pale, but calm, and S, another neighbour.  He was in a role of organiser and was calm and reassuring.  \nA voice calls to me from across the creek separating the neighbour’s house and mine across the valley.  It is my dear friend K, the one I had been just about to visit to get an egg for the crème caramel custards I was making for that night.  “Rosie, where are you?”  She followed my voice, clambering across the creek and arriving at S’s house where by now more and more of the neighbours were arriving, pale faced, each with their own trauma from the previous minutes.\nK had run from her home about 10 minutes away, anxious to locate me and see how I had fared.  She found the house, all doors swinging open and in such disarray and no me.  After spending some time with me we walked back to my property and got the car and found my dog, wet and covered in biddibids and terrified, and then we drove to check on other friends and back to K’s place so she could join her family.\nAnother shock hits and I look up and see rocks thundering down the hills about the Governors Bay Pub and the Llamas galloping in front, fanning out to avoid being hit.  Amazing and horrifying.\nI still do not know what has happened to my family. How are they, where are they? Texts are coming in sporadically, mostly people asking where are we, how are we, texts from the outside world, the unaffected world.\nI hear on a car radio from a man sitting in a driveway that the city is badly affected and that buildings are down and that there is loss of life.  My God.\nIt wasn’t until 4 days later as we settled into a motel in Kaikoura that were able to get on the internet and send a message to friends and family around the country and around the world to let them know how we had all fared.\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

Not stopping to wake my husband I tore out of bed to my baby’s room next door worried something would fall on him – I don’t think my feet touched the floor – then with my arms wrapped protectively around his head and body I yelled to my 4 year old that Mummy was coming while negotiating the buckling hallway, my body impacting from wall to wall.\nReaching my 4 year old son’s bedroom I realised I couldn’t get past his chest of drawers which had already fallen over so I scrambled onto the end of the bed still desperately clutching my baby, trying to grab him, my heart in my mouth, terrified that the house was going to come down around us – for surely it couldn’t put up with this much shaking???\nFrom behind I suddenly  felt my husband’s arms around us all as he ripped the duvet cover over our heads while the window in the bedroom smashed shattering glass around. \nWhen it finally stopped there was not a sound for about 5 seconds then the silence was broken by a million alarms going off.\nI knew there would be aftershocks and so we moved under the doorway in part of the hall away from windows and falling objects.\nI went to the lounge to grab my cellphone and found I couldn’t dial correctly – my hands were shaking so much from terror and adrenaline and I could hear my own breathing, harsh in my ears like I had just sprinted fast around the block.\nI woke family in Wellington thinking it must have originated there or at the Alpine Fault and hung up as soon as I knew they were ok to dial more friends and family as the text messages starting rolling in….”R U OK????” \nWith the light of my phone I went to grab a torch – the lounge was a mess, everything upturned… the dinning room glass sliding door had been thrown off its hinges and lay smashed on the floor overturning the computer table, all the equipment in its wake and I threw myself backwards onto the floor realising I would otherwise cut my feet on the broken glass which was intermixed with a broken potplant.\nAnother aftershock hit and I raced back to my family to the doorway.\nWhen it passed we decided to get the car out but with no power the garage door wouldnt open and the side door was very obviously twisted not allowing us in that way either.\nWhen dawn arrived, I nervously ran down the driveway to check on the neighbours hoping that another aftershock wouldnt hit while I was outside by myself.\n\nNo further sleep that day or the next while the earth continued to rumble, wobble and shake.",

        "text": "My Earthquake Experience, by Tim Kerr  – as recalled 20 May 2015\nThe February 2011 6.3 ‘quake that did so much damage and resulted in so many deaths was of no great moment for me. At the time I was employed as a temp driver for Steelbro, manufacturers of swing-lift container trailers. We had had a bit of a shake earlier in the day and all left the buildings and congregated in an orderly fashion at the CD area outside. Not a lot was happening, so we were dismissed. I was thirsty and had not eaten lunch. I climbed into my truck, an aged V8 Scania and with my copy of ‘The Press’ settled in for some lunch. Then my cell phone rang. Jim Takas, a friend of mine from Dunedin was on the phone. Was I OK? Well, of course I was! Then he told me a huge earthquake had caused chaos in the city. Shortly afterwards the stores’ manager Adrian Reid who was checking on damage and making sure no one was hurt or missing saw me. Surprised, he told me to go home as everybody else had gone. Finishing Jim’s call and following Adrian’s comments about going home I noticed there were a lot of cars on Treffers Rd, which was unusual for that time of day. So finishing my lunch I headed home. There was a lot of traffic and getting home was going to take a long time. This gave me an opportunity to fiddle with the radio in my van and tune into a radio station from which I learned this latest ‘quake was a bit of a shocker.\nWhile on the Curletts motorway overpass I noticed dust and fine gravel had been scraped out of the expansion joints and I thought, ‘Hmm, the Council road engineers have been pretty quick to check joints,’ Which seemed oddly efficient. A small aftershock then explained the clean expansion joints! The joints moved back and forward a couple of centimetres against each other, throwing out more sand and grit. I felt a lot better knowing I was on top of the bridge, rather than under it, like a lot of other congested traffic! My van had four wheel drive, I considered cutting across some curbs and grassed areas so I could get home more quickly, but felt that I would upset other drivers who were forced to stay on the road. So, like the rest of the traffic, I just waited. But, I knew, at least I had an option.\nAt some stage when I was caught in the traffic I received a phone call from ‘Lucille’ or someone with a similar name. On the phone was my partner, Lois. She had had a hospital appointment, her car was locked away in a hospital car-parking building and she had to walk home. She told me she was on Colombo St, but of course, I could not pick her up as I was stuck in traffic. While I was unaffected by the ‘quake, poor Lois had had a hell of a time. She caught the lift to the correct floor for her appointment and arrived ten minutes early, 12.50 pm. The earthquake struck at 12.51 pm, sealing the lift shaft that Lois had just evacuated. The ward became a total blackout. The Hospital staff, Lois explained, were, with one exception, very calm in the total darkness and after a short period the emergency lighting kicked in. Setting off homeward, with no access to her car, Lois had trouble orientating herself due to dust, damaged buildings, water and sand from liquefaction and the large number of pedestrians. A stranger, ‘Lucille’ loaned Lois her cell phone so she was able to call me. In her call Lois stated she was in Colombo St, in fact, she was probably in Antigua St. And of course, as she was using someone else’s phone I could not call her back. Lois got home OK, as did I, and we were able to pick her car up early the next morning.\nThe damage, and the deaths, I think, helped Lois overcome her own experience and the level-headedness of the hospital staff was also reassuring to her.\nI cannot remember there being much damage to our home. I guess the fridge door flung itself open casting the contents across the floor, same too, to the bookshelves with their books. With all the quakes I had personally not felt very threatened. Lois meanwhile, had taken to looking up Canterbury Quakes on the internet. While she focused on individual ‘shocks’ I would burble on about how the nature of large ‘quakes is there will be a series of aftershocks that would show, on average, a downward trend in size and frequency. And, of course, Lois had the graphics on the website – and she just scoffed at my drivel.\nSo, that, briefly, was my experience of the February 22 earthquake.  \nThe First Shock\nThe first earthquake in September 2010 was, to us, an exciting event. Like most of Christchurch we were in bed when the ‘quake woke us up. I yelled out to Lois “Grab a pillow and get down beside the bed!” I grabbed a pillow and lay down. To my surprise, Lois joined me. Instead of doing what I instructed, she strode to her wardrobe and grabbed a dressing gown and then came over to my side of the bed. I guess she thought, if she was going to die, she would die in my arms, more or less modestly dressed! Frankly, I didn’t give a bugger about my own nakedness!\nThe earthquake pretty well ruined our chances of getting back to sleep for a while, so working carefully through the debris (there was some broken glass) I went outside and picked up our copy of the morning Press, and went to the toilet to have a crap. That was deliberate, for nothing is more uncomfortable when rescuing people from the wreckage of earthquakes than full bowels! My advice, do it immediately and at least it is flushed – even if the sewage lines are damaged.  \nAt some stage I had popped outside for a pee – probably when fetching the morning paper. While doing so I heard an almighty rumble like a massive mountainside falling, so I assumed it was part of the predicted, massive Alpine Fault. “Well,” I thought, “This is a big ‘quake.” It was frosty outside, but we were tucked up warmly in bed with coffee, ‘The Press’, and our emergency radio. Sure, our bookshelves were chaotic, the house moved about a bit, but there seemed nothing particularly serious. We had food, heating (portable gas heater), a gas camping stove and gas hob on the kitchen oven, candles and even a few home-made candle sticks we made purely for civil emergencies. We also had a few days’ supply of fresh water. I used to joke that we would hang on to this or that in case of civil emergency. Our planning was not perfect though. Firstly, my bedside torch – which I kept in case of power cuts – had ‘new’ unused batteries in it. It was useless, detumescent to a tiny glow within minutes. Secondly, I had no bedside footwear. With a fair bit of broken glass around, footwear is very important. Finally, my advice to Lois to grab a pillow. Looking back after a few days I mildly wondered… I did nothing to save Lois – except yell out advice. I was clutching a pillow. What was the pillow really for? Protection from falling debris, or a trauma ‘cuddle’ toy – a substitute for a teddy bear? And why did I not stay on my feet to ‘supervise’ Lois, to make sure she was well protected from falling debris? It seems I was a bit of a coward – not heroic material at all!\nWith the streetlights still glowing, the two of us wrapped up and comfortable, as far as we were concerned it was a big earthquake, but not a particularly destructive one. We never thought to check on Lois’ mother or our neighbours! It may seem incongruous now, but the street lights were still working, so no reason to panic.\n\n\nI had assured Lois that we would be safe from falling chimneys about 3 weeks before the September Quake\nLater in the morning when we got up we looked up at our chimney. The ‘quake has caused it to twist and much of the mortar had fallen out. The top of an aluminium flexi-hose threaded down the original chimney connected to our gas fire in the dining room was cemented to the top of the chimney. It acted as a springy pinion allowing the bricks to move laterally, but preventing them from collapsing into a pile on the roof. \n\n\nThis little fella served as our chimney for two winters until an expert came along and disconnected our gas fire.\nAbout three weeks earlier Lois had expressed qualms about the chimney in the event of an earthquake and I had reassured her that an old chimney held together with lime mortar is pretty safe in earthquakes as it collapses into a pile of loose bricks rather than toppling in one piece like a cement-mortared modern chimney probably would.\nLiquefaction\n\n\nLiquefaction in Maces Rd, Bromley\nI used to joke with Lois about her house in Stourbridge St. It is a modern, brick veneer home on a concrete platform foundation. I used to tell her that her place wold be fine in an earthquake, it would sink into the ground with liquefaction – but she would be OK as she would still be able to climb out through the windows! Despite my callous comments, I had never seen earthquake liquefaction forming until the earthquake in June. With the June ‘quake I was parked in Cumnor Terrace when I felt the truck move towards me. It was quite a gentle quake so it took a few moments to realise the truck was moving because of the ‘quake, not because I had left the hand brake off. I saw tiny cones of sand erupt on the roadside. Water began flowing out of these tiny sand cones spreading silently across the road increasing in velocity until within a short while the road was under water. Ironically, I had a job servicing Port-a-loos and I had to get my truck back to Bromley sewage plant to empty it. The roads were increasingly flooding and naturally there were traffic hold-ups. However, I was able to get down Pages Rd to within a block or so from the entry to the City Council pumping station. The road was closed, but I spoke with one of the traffic controllers, explained that my goal was to get through the short section of closed road and I was let through. I drove steadily through the water, which was up to the bottom of my doors, and got to the pumping station where I was able to empty the truck. Shortly afterwards I had to go down Shortland St and on the approaching lane I saw an abandoned car, nose buried in a large water-covered pothole. But I was OK and was able to get to the depot at the end of the day.\nOn Guard\nDuring the first earthquake we had a lot of soldiers from Indonesia and Singapore in the city on some form of exercise. They were tasked – along with New Zealand military personnel – to man the barriers to the central city. They looked militaristic and seemed to enjoy the responsibility of the task. The role was taken over by reservists from the three military services, many from different parts of the country. They performed an effective role. Though obviously un-armed, they had two advantages over the police force when it came to ensuring no-one entered without authority. Police are trained to act within the community and therefore open to discussion and argument. Not the army though. They didn’t have to relate to the community. To any argument to gain access – no matter how important – the response was. “No access. Sorry sir, orders!” Also, the army is trained in boredom. Their role in military history has been days, weeks, months of little action. Sitting or standing around an access barrier all day was a relatively active compared to some military roles! \n\n\nService men – and women – controlled access to inner city Red Zone. They seemed to enjoy the somewhat boring task and were more effective than the police\nOne of the soldiers had a bit of a soft spot for me. She would offer me her military-issue lunch. No bully beef and hard tack biscuit for our military service! Her lunch consisted of a white bread sandwich and some sort of manufactured stuff like those awful packets of gooey ‘dip’ cheese and crackers. Plus a piece of fruit, not very sustaining. Guard duty became a boring task but I think the reservists enjoyed it and it probably added to their reservist skills. \nDangerous Goods\nIt must have been after the first, September earthquake. I was temping for EnviroWaste based in Barton St, Woolston. Two of us were tasked with entering the restricted area to remove dangerous goods from an outdoors goods retailer. We entered the shop at ground floor armed with a torch each, some plastic bags and the obligatory hi-vis vest and little plastic helmet. Our task was to remove all the camping gas canisters. I questioned the other guy I was working with about the fate of the gas canisters and was told that they would be dumped. A retailer’s entire stock of brand-new gas canisters to be dumped. The Gore-Tex jackets, expensive copper ‘Benghazi Burners’ and the rest of the stock was to remain in the shop. While we had access to reclaim the gas canisters I understand the retailer was not allowed entry. While we worked in the darkness of the ground floor, there was a team of workers on the first floor, whom we could plainly see as most of the façade of the building had been destroyed. To me, the restriction of access for retailers and business owners to claim their stock seemed to be a bloody farce.\nThe Water Tanker and Line Flushing\n\n\nLine flushing and CCTV inspection of sewers and storm water drains. An endless task that had to be done\nAt some stage I finished temping for Steelbro, and was offered a position operating a vintage 1960’s tanker and ancient automatic Scania. The rig was owned by a company for collecting used motor oil. I used the rig to supply water to an Auckland-based company, ‘Drain Surgeons’. The operators I was supplying did not like me as the tanker contained minute fragments of a bronze-like metallic particles, which could damage the CCTV and equipment used in line flushing. I gave the tanker and its filters a good going over, getting rid of the filings, but I was not wanted. I tried offering the rig to other companies but none were interested, so instead I did a lot of temping work operating tankers and vacuum pump trucks for a range of contractors. Ultimately I was offered a temp job with TransPac a listed Australian company that had entered the NZ market with a campaign of competition acquisition. In fact the company had overstepped its assets in Australia and to reduce debt, had to hive the New Zealand operations off to a Chinese company. Not that this had anything to do with earthquakes! But, the tempo of the company was to hire slow men to take it slowly and to wear excruciating amounts of PPE. Not the tempo I like working in.\n\n\nSometimes you had to take a closer look – City pump station out New Brighton way\nA Shit Job\nWith TransPac, a group of us had been hired as temps to drive and operate a small fleet of hastily cobbled together ‘dunny trucks’. Our job was to work our way round selected areas searching for, checking and where necessary emptying TransPac port-a-loos. What a job! The loos had been conscripted from different companies from all over the country, different makes with different methods of operation. One ghastly brand  relied on a lever activated metal belt that after use, the poor bugger forced to use the damn thing, had to crank forward to scrape clean for the next occupant. When the crank worked! The only positive feature of this model was the reluctance of the neighbours to use them and their relative scarcity – so locals generally used another port-a-loo down the road. Which meant we did not have to service them very often – a ‘shit job’.  The best, for ease of maintenance, were the simplest; a dunny seat over a tank of chemical impregnated water, toilet paper and shit. No fancy trapdoors, no water reticulation systems for flushing or washing hands. \n\n\nThis little one became my main shit truck. It wore out clutch mechanisms at a great rate. Several drivers were sacked for buggering it up. When having the little truck serviced I checked up on its history. It had had incessant clutch problems BEFORE it was allocated to the TransPac shit-collectors! \nThe World Hears of the Glory!\nThere were about ten or twelve workers in the original dunny cleaning team, but by attrition there remained a core group of whom, I mainly remember Lady Victoria and Maurice. Lady Victoria maintained she had a legitimate title, though her expletive-laden conversation would sow seeds of doubt on the veracity of such a claim. For some reason I called Maurice ‘Mor- reece’ rather than ‘Morris’. Maurice had met his first true love and though besotted with her, believed (wrongly) that other young lasses were irresistibly attracted to him. I phoned a reporter at ‘The Press’ to explain that no one had done an earthquake article on the shit collectors. Quickly overruling my own vain desire for publicity I suggested the reporter interview the other two. TransPac executives blew their collective stacks over publication of the article. \nMaurice mentioned that one thankful earthquake victim had given him a box of chocolates in appreciation of the shit job he had been doing for her. And Lady Victoria was able to tell the readership of her important title. A harmless article, the executives a bunch of useless wankers. Fortunately both were able to deny they were responsible for the article and of course no one thought to ask me if I had had a hand in the story. So, at that stage, none of us were sacked.\nOne of the two most important extremities of the Human Condition\n\nSure, we had a shitty job, but as I was able to point out to my workmates – and others who curious about our work – that we “Serviced one of the two most important extremities of the human condition”. I guess we took a bit of pride in that and I have to add, many earthquake victims were appreciative of our work and yes, did offer tips like chocolate bars or boxes of chocolates. Gradually as the sewer system was repaired or houses vacated there were fewer dunnies to service. Maurice and Lady Victoria – among others – were sacked – not thanked and dismissed but sacked for minor infringements. Meanwhile, the operating base was shifted from Waste Management in McAlpine St Sockburn to TransPac in Frankley St Bromley. There I began working with a very taciturn fellow Don. More and more of our work was servicing port-a-loos for builders and re-construction crews and supplying port-a-loos for public events. Some loos were out as far as Coalgate on the plains and Wainui on Banks Peninsula. I enjoyed my daily cycle commute to and from the place, and the physical demands of the job, but our esprit de corps was wearing thin as we were absorbed into the main body of TransPac employees. We were no longer an elite, independent team, but just another couple of dopey, overweight, regulation-ensnared workers forced to work a physically active job in overalls. It was like working in a plastic bag! In the end I got sacked leaving only Don who carried on for months until he found a better job elsewhere.\nInner City is a curious mess\nI was able to snap off a few shots when inside the inner city red zone. Most were taken while driving, so make little sense. However, some sites were quite enigmatic. \n\n\nMannequins suspended in an open frontage gently twisting in the breeze – unmolested for weeks. Bottom of High St and Manchester St\n\n\nCupola from the Regent Theatre Bldg. – originally 1903 Luttrell Bros designed Royal Exchange Bldg. The cupola mysteriously ‘disappeared’!\n\n\nInner city red zone\nHR Experts in High Heels \nThe saddest aspect of my lowly work was the mindless imposition of PPE. PP bloody E; one of endless acronyms, this one standing for Personal Protection Equipment! SCIRT laid down many of the rules. We were supposed to wear full legged and sleeved garments, steel-capped boots, helmet, hi-vis vest – and safety glasses. We worked in shorts. Why not? If we got a bit of shit on our leg we wiped it off with a bit of old rag and the anti-bacterial stuff we used for cleaning our hands. What do you do with a bit of shit stuck to your overalls? Go home and get a clean pair? Yeah right!! At my suggestion TransPac had us inoculated against hepatitis A and B. Other employees had been working in the job weeks before I started – and no bloody inoculations! So much for safety in the work environment!\nOf course we were all druggies, so we had to be tested randomly. If we had an accident (or a near miss) we had to report it. If we reported an accident we had to be drug tested. I was backing my truck up a steep, winding unsealed driveway on a farm property above Wainui on Banks Peninsula. My off-side mirror was totally obscured by vegetation hanging off the bank on my left. As I eased around a curve the rear of my truck struck a fence post. It did not damage the fence as there was no fence – just a post. However, I broke a tiny, flat reflector glued to the extremity of the truck deck. Being the simpleton I was expected to be, on my return to Christchurch I filled out a form reporting the accident. As a result, the next day I had to do a drug test – and I was reprimanded for not returning to Christchurch immediately after the accident. The truck, incidentally, had an additional pair of complying reflectors integrated into the taillight assembly. Asked why I did not see the post I explained that my view out the driver’s side mirror was of blue sky. With the vegetation rendering my off-side mirror useless and the post being on a curve, it had not appeared in my vision. I was prescribing a curve, the post was still behind the truck not yet in range of the mirror. No wonder the Christchurch rebuild is costing billions!\nMany of the properties I had to service were down long driveways. As time went by the trees and shrubs down many of these driveways extended further out into the drive. We wanted to ask the owners to trim the driveways – but oh, that was not our responsibility! We had to go through our ‘management’ to get driveways trimmed. We tried that, it never happened. In a couple of places I took my own secateurs and carved a tunnel for the mirrors. \nIn some disability home in Innes Rd I was severely reprimanded for ‘ruining’ a garden. Stepping on the garden (amongst bloody roses!) I had to climb up onto the top of the truck and down the back to connect the hoses etcetera, then return over the top of the truck to start the pump and climb back over the top of the truck to access the hoses to clear the toilets. The ‘damage’ to the garden apart from a couple of inches of tyre tracks was minimal – and the most valuable plant apart from roses was convolvulus! I worked out an alternative way of servicing the toilets which involved reversing through a mass of undergrowth and skirting a brick wall. Here though, I had to ask the chatelaine to move her car. She only did this under duress. She was a bitch.\nBut what really annoyed me with our Health and Safety stuff was the universal instruction on how to lift a box. A box! What about a bucket of water? What about working on one’s own and the bucket is above chest level? And paper cuts. Oh dear, a paper cut is an ACC event worthy of a week’s recuperation!\nThank you to the ladies in high heels who design and educate us on safety in the workplace….\nServicing extremities of the human condition comes to an end\nFrom time to time and as the frequency of earthquakes decreased I was offered other temp work. Some of it operating vacuum trucks or water tankers for sewer and storm-water flushing and CCTV operations. I did not enjoy the work for helmets (I hate wearing hats of any sort) safety glasses and overalls became compulsory. Often the hours were long by which I mean each hour was long.. And there were many of them! One day, when driving a little City Council Libraries truck distributing library books amongst the various city libraries an earthquake struck just as I was finishing the last pick-up for the day. I received a call over my phone telling me to ‘drop everything and return to the depot immediately.’ Well, I had the rear hoist down and some ‘buckets’ of books to stow away and tie down. Despite being ordered to drop everything I completed the task at hand. You only had to look at one or two years data to know that aftershocks were smaller, and if felt at all, more than 20 minutes apart. Dropping the task at hand and returning to the depot was silly. Finishing the task and getting into the truck was safer than returning immediately to a concrete depot to await another ‘big one’!\nThe Sociology of Portable Dunnies\n\n\nSome attempted to make their Port-a-Loo a little more homely. I took pleasure in maintaining this one in Locksley Ave\nInitially we did our best to service about 80 dunnies a day. In the period following the earthquake the port-a-loos were unpleasant for everyone, but especially so for the poor buggers having to use them. They became foul and there were too few for the affected population – and we simply could not do a good job on 80 dunnies a day. (A competitor had a fleet of trucks servicing about 100 dunnies a day – but with two operators’ per truck, we were on our own.)\n\n\nA real party piece. The hosts claimed they entertained 40 guests in here! Pages Rd\nAs time went by, we were able to more properly service them and they became progressively more pleasant for residents to use. With more time and ability to do a better job came a sociological ‘map’ of the various neighbourhoods. For example the doggie poo bags that were tossed into the dunnies along Dallington Tce, Rockinghorse Rd and Sumner. Linwood from Oliviers Rd to Aranui would be smothered in graffiti and ignition attempts. (And no, the dunnies would not ‘blow up’ if a match was set to them, they were too well ventilated) \n\n\nTypical builder’s loo – literally ‘The Office’!\nManchester St and parts of Phillipstown would have intravenous needles scattered around and in them. Dallington Wainoni schools and dunnies in Rydal Rd, Hoon Hay often contained packaged sandwiches and plastic lunch boxes and in Rydal Rd, lots of graffiti. In Heathcote and Avonside attempts had been made to feminise and decorate dunnies. In Richmond several dunnies were used as a deposit for bundles of ‘New World’ household advertising circulars. In Waltham and Sydenham it was great sport to deliberately tip the dunnies over, and around Hagley park and dotted about the city you could pick out underpants, women’s knickers and, oddly, bras. One dunny near the Avon Loop was used as a receptacle for shark fillets. Some, out Shirley-way were receptacles for disposable nappies.   \n\n\nThe author working in Selwyn St just a couple of doors away from home. (Photo M D Kerr)\nThe work tapers off\nAs the immediate damage of the Canterbury earthquakes faded away rebuild opportunities arose. Some of the work was site clearance work driving dump trucks, but as this work declined I became more involved with ‘horizontal rebuild’ work. That is, the rebuild and repair of roads and drains mostly under the aegis of SCRIT, where full length sleeves and trousers, safety glasses, Lego helmet, gloves and high-vis vest were mandatory. No way will I work in 23-29 degrees dressed like that! So my earthquake experiences faded away. I have to state that despite the low wages and nature of the work I enjoyed it – and I felt I was doing something useful for the community, more useful and rewarding than voluntary work. Also, despite the grubby mess in some of the areas I worked, on the whole the work was appreciated.\nOur own house repaired\nWe had repairs done to our home which in the middle of winter 2014 were scheduled for two weeks. We rented a campervan and set off for a trip around parts of the North Island. In the cold, damp winter’s weather plaster and paint work would not dry and the two weeks dragged on to seven and a half weeks. Unfortunately, when up in the Coromandel my partner’s mother took ill and we had to return to Christchurch. Reduced to having to overnight in Christchurch every second day or so and having to camp outside our own garage for many of those days, we were still thankful that we had not moved into a motel, to be trapped there for seven or eight weeks.",

        "text": "The Red Baron & Earthquakes\n\nA story of Anger – Trauma – Encouragement – Compassion, and Hope.\nMy little car was a beauty, a Mitsubishi Mirage Dingo, with only 43,000 ks on the clock a 1.3 litre car. It wasn’t until I spotted this other one in a yard one day exactly the same as mine but it had tinted windows and a better motor 1.5 litre Gdi and only 27,000 k’s. I was hooked so I changed mine for it. What the Gdi stood for I don’t know. (Something injection.) Lovely high seats for comfort, just a beauty!\n\nOn the back window I had the words  “The Red baron“ which I changed because my wife didn‘t like it, to “L.B.W.” which were my initials and most people thought of “Leg before wicket.” I couldn’t get the number plate as someone had it, but they said I could have it as I L.B.W. I If I wanted it, but I declined.\nLeading Up To Events.\nMy name is Lawrence and I am a 72 yr old New Zealander born and bred in Christchurch.\n\nI was made Paralysed by medical misadventure.\n\nIt all happened on the 4th July 2010 when I was asked to have an MRI scan and I was in extreme pain after having a disc in my back collapse and all my nerves were crushed. As I sat in the waiting room it got worse and I could hardly walk, and had to be assisted up onto the MRI table and down again.\nThose who had the knowledge and power to say “Off to the Hospital” had diagnosed me wrong. The Radiologist showed me the severity of my Disc collapse but chose to say, “You’ll be ok,” and sent me home. I had an injection from my own Dr, but it didn’t alter the pain at all.\n\nWithin just a few hrs I was rushed to A&E dept Christchurch Hospital for urgent surgery as I had become paralysed from the waist down. The Ambulance staff carried me out from my bed to the Ambulance outside. I felt every bump in the road on the journey to the hospital but the ambulance men were very good at their job calming me down as much as possible.\nI had to endure being there at A&E lying flat on my back and in excruciating  pain watching others who were just drunk and a young girl who slit her wrists because she wasn’t getting attention fast enough. This in turn took the Dr’s away from me.\nSo many people coming in (Mainly elderly) and those who even in the early hrs of the morning had been in accidents. It took my mind off things for a moment.\n\nMy wife was at my side and also my Daughter which was lovely to see as they kept me calm by talking just about everything. What a blessing they were to me.\n\nI had an ECG, and Pic line inserted with injections going in to try and lower the pain level which helped only slightly.\nThey said I would have to have an x-ray because my heart wasn’t functioning properly. ( I had Atrial Fibrillation). It skipped a beat every four beats and sent blood rushing to my head. Sometimes it made me light headed.\n\nAfter being wheeled into the x-ray room by this young attendant, and being bumped around going through doorways (and I felt every one) they said that I had to sit up and I thought, Why can’t they just slide the board under me? It just didn’t make sense?\nI was made to sit up to a 90 degree angle and as they pushed just that little bit more I felt something in my back snap and the pain was greater than the first. The young girls had snapped two bones off my disc or spine and I was in extreme agony.\n\nApologies were made (I think?) and I finally was wheeled into the surgery room after getting the appropriate injections.\nI came out of surgery and the first thing the surgeon said was Quote “It was the largest disc I have ever seen and I removed two other bones that had broken off as well. The disc blew out of your back and hit me on the chest” Unquote. \n\nCan I show this to the medical school here? I told him that’s fine go for it.\nI spent 5 days in ICU and then transferred to ward 28 on this wonderful bed which had all the mod cons fitted but as I was wheeled past the reception part of the ward the nurse in charge said in a loud voice, “Oh! No! you can’t have that bed in here.” I hoped she was only joking but she wasn’t and I had to have a standard bed.\nEarthquakes and things \nFinally I was taken by ambulance to Burwood Spinal Unit where I was to be there for about five months.\n\n It was here that my story starts regarding Earthquakes and things. \n\nThey had wheeled me into a room, and before long the nurses brought someone else in so I had someone to talk to. \nHe appeared to be a small man, but then after talking to him I realised that this man they brought in had been run over by a train, and it happened because he slipped on new paint on the platform as it had been raining.  The doors were locked on the train and he couldn’t get on.\n\n He fell under the moving train and ended up with just one small left limb, no legs or hands, and no right limb at all. I don’t know how he survived. He didn’t seem to know who he was and his story was in the papers across New Zealand.\nI spoke to the head nurse Anna who came to help me and said to her, “He must be the worst case here, and to my surprise she said “No!” you are. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing anyway as time went by the nurses changed me as I had lost Bladder and Bowel control which had to be attended to daily three or four times & injections every four hrs for infections that had taken place. (Chest, Bladder, Stomach, and I felt feverish and was shaking and had pneumonia. \nI didn’t know in the thick of things I would experience a Quake as large as 7.1 Magnitude, and when it struck, my bed moved sideways a foot here and there with tremendous force, and as I could only see the ceiling I watched in horror as it all moved back and forth. I hung onto the rails of the bed and wondered where to now?\n\nI thought the whole place was going to crash down around my ears. It was a deafening noise with the ceiling creaking and groaning and making ungodly noises. \nThere was nothing I could do and I just yelled to my room mate, “Are you Ok!. He replied in a quiver, “Yeah I think so.” He wasn’t with it. I told him to Trust God!\nThe nurses came scurrying in and asked if we were ok! and after assurances they left, but before they left I said “How are we going to get out of here? and they replied, “through the sliding door,” we will take you onto the grass outside.\n\nSure I thought and if the door was jammed or something they wouldn’t fit us all into the hallway as there were too many patients, but they were lovely and efficient and calmed us down one by one.\nNo- body knew of the trauma, the anguish and anxiety I felt over the months following, the hopelessness I felt not being able to walk or do normal things.\n\nI got so angry at God first, telling him that I had done all these things for him and had showed his love to so many, why did he allow this to happen to me then I fought the shock and trauma etc, until finally succumbing to acceptance of how I was.\n\nThe after shocks were terrible and added to the fear and anxiety I was feeling.\n\nAll I could do was stare at the ceiling hoping another quake wasn’t going to come. I hid this fear inside away from my visitors and wife.\nI had to go through so much with humiliation in the days following after soiling myself and wetting the bed because I had no control over my body ( Bladder and Bowel.) The after shocks certainly didn’t help and I felt terrified by them. I would wake up in the early hours with pyjamas soaking wet from stress and have to have them changed.\n\nThe nurses were great some stayed in their little square they built for themselves while others moved out of the square and really helped. They were a blessing to me.\nI knew them all by name and it was a pleasure talking to them as they came every few hrs to check and change things like the bed and my pj’s. They helped in my recovery so much with early Rehab, Physio, and things like that. There was Lena, and Kate, Kathy, Christine, Angela, Anna, and Nathan the manager to name a few.\n\nRaj the head Dr  of the unit was absolutely marvellous as well and understanding. He knew my limitations and was positive in speaking to me which in turn made me that way too!\nThen their was Rosie the receptionist who always spoke with politeness, and helped with anything I asked for. The Physio girls were great too especially the Irish one who went by the name of Kathy Robinson. She pushed me pass my limit and got me on my feet much quicker. I used to tell her Irish jokes like this one. “This Irish man went to town sightseeing and while looking around the city he found he needed to go to the toilet.\n\nHe couldn’t seem to find one and lo and behold came across this large church and said to himself “There has to be one in there! He swung opened the doors and as he looked down the isle, there at the end he saw these two boxes. He didn’t know that they were confessional boxes and that the priest was in one waiting for someone to come for confession.\n\nHe dashed inside the left one and heard this person next door going “Ahem” (The priest was trying to get his attention. Again he heard “Ahem”, but in a louder volume. Finally the priest banged on the wall to get this guys attention, and the Irishman said back, “Hey it’s no good banging, I’ve got no paper in here either. Ha! Ha!\nI achieved so much in the Gym that they presented me with an award . (But I’m getting ahead of myself).\n\nI thought I was handling things quite well with progressing a little here and there. The shock was when the Head surgeon had said “You will never walk again” I don’t know if the quake was worst or what he said about walking.  It hit me hard and I withdrew into myself. The after shocks never let up and made me nervous.\nAs a Christian of some forty odd yrs I rebuked those words the Surgeon said, and set about doing what I could in the gym and exercising when I could. I would Pray every night “Father make me whole again let your healing anointing flow over me and heal my body. Let restoration come. I never let up day and night praying pestering the Lord.\nAs each day came and went, changes came and out of the blue while watching a game of the All Blacks with my son in law Rick, my toes began to wiggle. The game became second as Joy and Exhilaration took place. I was over the moon and as the weeks and months ticked by My prayers changed from asking to thanking, \n\n“Father thank you for the Restoration and Healings upon my body.” Thank you for hearing my cries, and for answering my prayers. \nI met one of the Crusaders Nasi, and his manager and even spoke with John Key the prime minister who visited the Hospital. When he came over to my bed I made sure I said about the elderly, that they needed a pay rise. I hope he took me seriously.\n\nSomewhere down the track, and after much Physio and hard work in Rehab I thought I was now ready to get out onto the road and go home, but I still had to endure the last month in a place called TR ( Traditional Rehab). It was here that they put you through your paces and taught you everything you needed to know about life as a disabled person. Travis and Fiona were just great people who spent time helping us.\nWe learnt things like cooking, and cleaning, and washing dishes, preparing meals for others once a week, and even hanging clothes on the line. I even played pool with two nurses behind me in case I fell, and fall I did at one time luckily not causing any damage as I had no feeling in one of my legs. It was so easy to break a leg.\nIt made me laugh when I couldn’t move and after some time the nurse Kathy (the Irish one) came over and said, “Lawry you’re standing on your foot”. yet they didn’t put you down for your mistakes but lovingly looked after you. \n\nWhile learning how to walk in the Gym this ball was in my way and I tried kicking it away but I used my wrong foot and almost fell. Thank goodness my instructor Kathy who was always with me and saw the event was there to steady me. I guess I got over confident at times. I was like that always doing double what they said.\nOnce a week we went out to get groceries with one of the staff always at our side in case we stumbled or got into difficulty.\n\nI eventually was able to play mini golf in my wheelchair as a final rehab thing and to my surprise got two holes in one and won a pass to come again free. It made me feel good. I also got a cup for the best in Archery at Burwood, and believe it or not split an arrow down the middle just outside of the centre goal. They called me Robin Hood and  took a photo of it and pasted it on the achievement wall in TR. Ward.\n\n I didn’t tell them I was a junior champion from way back until much later and then I helped others to achieve better results by teaching them how to hold the bow properly and stand and things like that. \nI pestered the nurse to allow me to try a test for driving in my little Red car, and eventually was given an all Ok! The nurse in charge put me on this machine to test my reactions and I passed the test to drive my car as my right leg was getting better even though my left one still needed work on it. My car was automatic.\n I passed my driving test at Burwood Hospital and then another by driving around Christchurch streets and busy intersections with two instructors I passed my final test with flying colours. “Whoopee! I was so excited to say the least. I finally was released to go home with my new wheelchair.\nDisaster Day\nThey sent me a letter a few days later to say I had to come into the hospital for rehabilitation in the pool swimming etc.\n\nThe day was the 22nd of February and I pulled into the hospital behind the chapel.\n\nThe time was almost 1:50 pm or there about. I got out of the car and put my wheelchair onto the ground as I was trained by Burwood staff to do when all of a sudden it struck. A massive 6.3 Quake. \nThe ground lifted up in front of me in a dozen places and I got thrown into the back of my car rocking to and fro. What a nightmare people running everywhere and nurses coming and checking if all was Ok! A gas bottle had broken it’s coupling and was thrown onto the ground not far from my car. I was fortunate it didn’t hit me.\n\nA lady came out screaming she had fallen inside and hit her head which was bleeding.\n\nDr’s and nurses came running out and it made me laugh as Dr’s checked their flash cars for any damage.\nI had to sit for 15 minutes or so to calm down. I thought “How can I get out,” the road had lifted quite a lot. Was my little car able to get through over the humps? I didn’t want to fall into any holes as I knew quakes could open the ground wide.\n\nI finally went out onto the road to go back home which was a journey of two hrs. \nThings were crazy. We were bumper to bumper all the way with water, liquefaction  almost a mitre high and at times I’M sure my little car lifted off the road ,and I thought I am going to end up into the river. This turkey had come from the other direction and was driving fast making a big wave. When it hit my little car it  lifted up off the road. It was terrifying for me as I couldn’t walk and thought I might drown or something. One lady had gone down a hole and had to be towed out by a 4×4 truck.\nWhat could I do the water had made me think I needed to go to the toilet and I ended up being in pain as I held on. No good going out in the water I couldn’t walk to the back of the car for my emergency bag which had my catheter in it. \n\nThank God I finally got home. A quarter of an hour ride there, and two hours getting back home. All the time I was thinking “How is my wife? Is she Ok? I hope she’s not hurt.\nWhat a mess our home was in, stuff everywhere, my office had everything on the floor, clothes in bedroom on the floor, bathroom a mess, cabinets broken, and all our antiques broken that I had kept for so long. GONE! Telly on the floor no good anymore and just bought a few months earlier. \nAnd so the journey ends and I thank God we are Alive!\nWhat man said couldn’t be done, “God made possible.”  Praise The Lord!\nToday although not free completely of Trauma and stress, I can say without fear, and with integrity and with a positive statement that  “I can walk,” \n\nYes, I can walk, I put aside the walker they gave me and walk unaided for short bursts, and as each day goes by I get stronger and stronger.” \nI look back to all the get well cards 30 odd, and the people who visited me and gave support, the coloured pictures from my grandkids and  even Elim Church who not only looked after my wife with food and things but made visits to the ward to see me.\n\n Especially Don and Sue who gave so much of their time to come and sit by my side and just chat. Thank you guys.\nThe Pastor, Clinton Kelleher even came and prayed for me and it all helped in my recovery. Such a colourful character he was and funny too!\n\n Without the prayers of loved ones, and my endurance to succeed I would not have made it. My special thanks to all who have been part of my recovery and especially Helen my wife. What an outstanding person!",

        "text": "Risingholme Orchestra and its continuing history post earthquakes – a tale of wandering minstrels\nRisingholme Orchestra was formed in 1991 by a group who wanted to cater for older players by rehearsing during the daytime.  It has met at Risingholme Theatre in Opawa, an old style school hall, on a Thursday morning where a large enough rehearsal space was available and equipment could be stored.  Members of the orchestra have largely been in the over 60s category although younger players have also been welcome.  The Orchestra has given public concerts two or three times a year and these are always a goal to be worked towards.  At the beginning of 2011 there were about 55 members.\nWhen the earthquake of 4th September 2010 occurred we were able to continue using Risingholme Theatre as it was not damaged and we were preparing for the planned November concert.  However, at least one member lost her home though a number of us were not greatly affected.\nWe began the new year of 2011 in the usual way with a new rehearsal programme.  With the February 22nd earthquake all was to change as we were suddenly without our rehearsal space; Risingholme Theatre was deemed unable to be occupied and was yellow-stickered.  So many rehearsal places and concert venues were lost and there was a scramble to find suitable spaces.  Our patron, John Emmeleus, had suggested that St Paul’s Church hall in Papanui could be a possible rehearsal venue. The Orchestra did not meet on the Thursday following the earthquake as so many of us were in alternative accommodation and facing the prospect of demolition or major repairs to our homes.  One of our flute players, Donna Tairakena, lost her husband in the collapse of the CTV building.  Nine days after the earthquake our conductor, Tony Ferner, suggested that those who were available should meet at his home for morning tea and then adjourn to St Paul’s Church Hall for a short rehearsal.  About thirty players were able to come and take part in that first rehearsal post earthquake.  Some photographs were taken at that time and a member commented that in retrospect the assembled group looked rather shell shocked.\nThe orchestra continued to meet at St Paul’s for some weeks, preparing for the concert in May in the Elmwood School auditorium.  This venue had previously been booked for the concert and was fortunately not damaged.  As time progressed and more of the players returned the lack of space at the St Paul’s hall proved to be a problem. (It was two years before some key players were able to rejoin the orchestra but we were able to employ a few professionals to fill the gaps for concert performances).\nBy the middle of the year (June 2011) we moved to a new rehearsal space in the church hall of St Martins Presbyterian Church.  One of our players, Bernard Brettell, was a parishioner and organised this for us.  The equipment (percussion, timpani and music and chairs) which had been stored at the Risingholme Theatre was finally removed and the Church gave us storage space for it.  At each rehearsal the chairs were moved from storage to the Hall and returned to storage after rehearsal. We thought we were happily settled for some time but it was not to be.  The Church Hall was red stickered later in 2011 following the June earthquake and was subsequently demolished.  The Church very kindly allowed us to use the Church itself; this meant that before each rehearsal the pews had to be moved and repositioned at the end of the morning.  We appreciated the rehearsal space but it was a considerable effort each day to make the space available. We found ourselves competing with a large craft group for the limited toilet facilities and battled the long walk carrying instruments to and from our cars while road works continued outside the Church for many months.  To our dismay the Church was deemed to be a safety risk in August of 2012 and was red-stickered.  Once again we were on the move, this time to the Woolston Club which had been suggested as a possible venue by the Orchestra’s trombone player, Jill Fenton.  The Club has been most accommodating so that we have a large rehearsal space and storage for the timpani, easy parking and great facilities.  Rooms are also available when we require them for sectional rehearsals and we continue to rehearse there at the time of writing, more than four years after the initial earthquake.  With our move to the Woolston Club we realised how much more work it had been at the Church but our determination to continue had seen us through very challenging times.\nOur chairperson, Helen Reddecliffe, in her report for the 2011 AGM said, “After the recent earthquakes, many of us are taking a second look at our priorities and finding that Risingholme Orchestra on Thursday mornings is an integral part of life that we look forward to. I do not doubt that we need bread, butter and toilets, but I cannot live for these alone! Now more than ever it is important to engage in activities “for the soul”.  While we sadly miss those no longer with us, we continue as a cohesive group and the excitement is mounting as we now tackle the new repertoire for our next concert.”\nIn 2012 the orchestra was approached by the Kaiapoi Theatre Company to provide players for a concert version of the musical Chess, which they were to present in September of that year.  Thirty seven players of our players agreed to provide the orchestra and with extra weekend rehearsals we prepared for the two concert performances.  We felt that we were contributing to the community at a time when there was little entertainment and so many people were living in intolerable conditions.  While the Chess rehearsals were going on, about 20 members took part in chamber music groups at our regular rehearsal times.  \nOur outreach in to the community has also involved taking short programmes to schools; Darfield in 2011, Waltham in 2012, West Spreydon in 2013 and Addington and Philipstown in 2014.\nPerformance venues in Christchurch have become more difficult to find since the earthquakes and we have been fortunate to be able to use the Elmwood School Auditorium and when this was not available we secured the Avonhead School Hall.\nAt the time of writing about 80% of our players are senior citizens with several in their 90s and a number in their 80s.  It has been an important meeting point for the group since the earthquakes as it has provided a regular focus on music when so much has been happening in members’ lives.  Hardly anyone has been left untouched by the damage the earthquakes have caused to their homes and the continuing temporary moves required for repairs or rebuilds is stress-inducing. That the Orchestra has survived the many moves of rehearsal venues is testament to the importance of its continuance in the lives of its players as well as the willingness of our conductor, Tony Ferner, to provide us with the will and inspiration to make good music.\nCompiled by Lyndsay Fenwick, Helen Reddecliffe and Philippa Graham",

        "text": "22 Feb 2011 started off as not a normal day – I was off on annual leave as my daughter was having her wisdom teeth out at 3pm.\nMyself and my daughters went to The Palms Shopping Mall to have some lunch before the extraction of her teeth.  \nWe had just left Farmers and were walking to the food court when the shake happened.  There was no where to run.  We stood like statues unable to move.  We had a rubbish tin by us that we knelt beside.  My youngest daughter who was 15 screamed and looked up to the high ceiling only to see the sky and the thought of all the glass smashing on top of us.\nWhen the initial shake finished we ran towards the exit only to be told by someone to slow down… there was no way we were slowing down.  \nOn the way running towards the exit we ran past what we thought were two bodies face down on the ground, however the closer we got we could see that it was 2 mannequins fallen out of the shop window – phew.\nA huge dust cloud was escaping K-marts entrance as we flew past.\nWe stood outside the mall on the other side of the road for ages and watched the streets fill up with water and muck.\nWe pulled up our jeans, took off our shoes and waded through the streets hoping that we wouldnt fall into any holes (as you couldnt see the ground) to get to my car that was on ground level.\nLuckily my car was not damaged as the car next to me had a bit of the carpark fall on it.\nWhat would normally take around 15 minutes to get home took about 2 hours and it wasnt until then that we saw cars eaten up by the ground and liquefaction and that Christchurch was in trouble.\nMy eldest daughter is so lucky that she wasnt sitting in the Dentist chair at 12.51pm that day.",

        "text": "I live in a second story flat in Sydenham. Like almost everyone, when the September earthquake hit I was asleep in bed. I remember waking to the distinctive sound of the rumble before the earthquake hit the surface.\nFor a second I sat bolt up right in bed but once I saw how violently the things around me were beginning to be shaken and knocked over I rushed to get out of bed and make my way to the safety of my bedroom doorway. Unfortunately whilst on my way to the doorway I got hit by my falling television (an older, heavier, box style 21’ inch TV) which landed against me, hitting my elbow and forearm. The force of the television pinning me to my bed for a number of seconds before I found the strength to push the television off of me which then landed on my foot before rolling to the floor and landing on my deodorant can (which was once a round can and is now an almost oblong shape.)\nAfter my wrestle with my television I made it to the doorway where I saw the rest of my belongings around my flat being thrown around. I then noticed all of my blinds being pushed open by the force of the earthquake, within seconds from that, which felt like minutes, the shaking stopped.\nTo my horror, as I was looking out of my second story window through the now open blinds, at that second I saw what was like a ripple affect across south Christchurch as the power cut out. It was such a surreal moment, made worse by the airy sound of alarms whaling in the distance which seemed to immediately follow the power cut.\nThe months and weeks following the September earthquake were like torture for most of us here in Christchurch. The first few days were full of flashbacks and fear produced by the memories of our own experiences and made worse with every aftershock which it seemed only hit when we began to feel a tiny bit comfortable. \nThe days and weeks following the September earthquake were made harder for me as I discovered that the force of the earthquake had pushed my night store heater to its limit, left hanging to the wall by one bolt and only one side of the bracket.\nMy night store heater eventually wore away with the aftershocks being quite forceful. Eventually it fell over completely, landing with an almighty thud. Unfortunately for me the thud was made worse as I was not quick enough to react and it landed on my foot, breaking my big toe, damaging the nerves and causing severe bruising to my foot not too mention trapping me for nearly an hour as I struggled to free my foot from under the weight of the night store.\nFor nearly nine weeks I was forced to rely on the use of crutches and other people’s generosity to get through and undertake the general day-to-day tasks until I could eventually begin to weight bare as the swelling slowly went down enough to be able to wear shoes.\nIn late November I was incredibly thankful to have received a Red Cross Grant to cover medical bills that I incurred following my foot injury. I am still to this day ever so great full to have received that financial support as well as the support of my amazing neighbours and lovely friends.\nOn February 22nd I went about my day-to-day business as usual. We’d been living through aftershocks here for nearly six months, I guess it became apart of our day-to-day lives here in Christchurch. They didn’t really seem to faze me as much as they had, but every now and then I’d have a bit of a panic attack when a bigger one raised its presence. \nI guess over the last few months of these shocks sleep become a secondary for me (and no doubt for many others here,) for those months I was too scared to go to sleep in complete darkness. It sounds stupid now, but I figured that if I kept a light on and an aftershock hit I’d be able to see my way to the door frame or see if anything was falling towards me. It worked for a while but gradually as my flash backs diminished my fear of the darkness did too. I guess I got more ‘comfortable’ with them. \nThat’s pretty much what happened on February 22nd, at first I just thought “Oh crap that’s a bigger one” but it got more and more violent and threw both my twin brother and I from side to side as we tried to grab on to one-another while my second story flat shook and swayed violently and all of my things flew absolutely everywhere.\nBeing upstairs often meant for me that even the mildest aftershocks made things fall so when the 6.3 quake hit on February 22nd, just like in September; my flat was absolutely trashed. My DVD’s and CD’s flew all over the ground when both the racks fell over. My book shelf tipped forward, picture frames came off the wall. My 29inch TV, DVD player, surround sound unit and play station (as well as my TV in my bedroom) all tipped over completely. My filing cabinet, all of my kitchen draws and pantry flew open. Glasses also came off the bench in the kitchen and smashed all over the floor.\nThat was just inside, outside my heat pump fan unit out on my balcony moved forward by almost over a meter (stretching all of the pipes and wires to their limits) the fan unit moving also moved and tipped the glass coffee table that I have out on the balcony next to a wooden outdoor chair which also moved from its place.\nImmediately after the February quake I wanted to get outside and down stairs onto more solid ground (as I found the building swaying very difficult) but I found that all of my neighbours had the same idea. Unfortunately later on as my nerves were a little more settled I thought I’d go back up to my flat but as I got nearly all the way up the steps another strong aftershock hit, rattling me once more. I stood there frozen, eventually I noticed my twin brother had gone ahead and was starting to tidy up. I didn’t know where to start so I decided to start on the kitchen. My twin brother and I almost completely tidied it up the kitchen until another large aftershock hit, tipping the fridge almost on top of me, if my twin brother hadn’t have helped me push it away I could have had yet more injuries.\nAfter that I decided it wasn’t worth tidying up anything else so I went round the house turning all the power off at the wall because a lot of my electrical appliances were either broken or tipped over so I didn’t want anything else to go wrong when the power eventually came back on.\nMy twin brother and I then decided to go and check on family near by but as we were leaving I couldn’t get my door closed (It was left open when the earthquake hit) it took both my twin brother and I to literally pull the door closed. It appeared the door frame had moved and the floor had lifted, lifting the carpet also. I didn’t think much of it at the time but when I came back to my flat I couldn’t even get the door open, (not on my own) that’s when the reality of it hit me. That night I had no real option other than to stay with my parents out in the country, (west of Christchurch in Prebbleton) until I could get hold of my landlord about the door at my flat.\nWith little sleep and the reality of my neighbours and friends having no water in the city I decided I would make use of being out in Prebbleton with well-water so I filled up three dozen bottles with the fresh well-water and took them to my neighbours houses and a near by Retirement Village. While I was in the area I decided to check my flat for any further casualties from the continuing aftershocks and found it was again a huge struggle to open my door but I eventually got in there and shoved the door almost closed without thinking and therefore became temporarily stuck in there as I struggled to open the door on my way out. \nI didn’t get to go back home after that until the 3rd of March because all of the builders around the city were jam-packed with all the other earthquake damage around the city and even then it was a temporary fix where they pulled up the carpet so I could open and close the door without anything catching on it.\nI was so glad to be home but a few weeks later I found that along with my heat-pump not working, my hot water cylinder was leaking so I had to get a plumber out and they replaced the pipes. Two days after these repairs my hot water cylinder over heated and over flowed onto the roof, it was soon found that the thermostat had blown so I then got a new thermostat fitted but was told it was a temporary fix until they would order the proper one for it.\nIn May I was still having a lot of trouble with my hot water cylinder not heating properly and seemingly heating the water 24-7 (using heaps of power!!) because it couldn’t get to the correct temperature. By early June I had had the plumber and the electrician out numerous times but had still not got the heat-pump checked so I asked my landlord to get onto it for me.\nAt that stage things seemed to be settling down a bit with the aftershocks when seemingly suddenly on June 13th big shocks hit us once more, these shocks made my TV fall over once more, this time smashing it, along with my oil heater which got bent out of shape and cracked open along with my iron that fell out of the cupboard and broke it. Again my heat-pump fan unit moved significantly and this time around we had no water or sewage and power outages over the following days.\nThinking about how much my life has changed in the last 11 months is overwhelmingly astonishing. How much in my day-to-day life now evolves around where I am, what’s around me, where I park my car, what I have with me, who is around, where emergency exits are, asking myself if there’re torches around etc. I actually now barely remember what life was like pre-September 2010. \nYou know, hearing about the Haiti earthquake last year and thinking that I didn’t have any idea what that must have been like, I couldn’t ever imagine living through something like that until now where we’ve lived through several major earthquakes now. It really is life changing.",

My brother was then taken to Christchurch hospital and had his legs plastered with still no news on his partner or baby daughter. The next day my parents travelled up from Dunedin to pick me up and to make sure my brother was coping OK. I went and had my x-rays at Canterbury Radiology and was then sent away, on the way back to Dunedin I recieved a call saying when I returned to Dunedin I should go into the hospital just for a check-up and to make sure everything was ok, my parents dropped me off at the hospital and were going back up to Christchurch to help with the search for Kelsey and Taneysha and they told me to give my sister a call when I was ready to go home that day. \nAfter being looked at by the specialist in Dunedin I was then admitted to Dunedin hospital because they picked up that I had an infection in my foot. After 2 days my brother got a transfer to Dunedin hospital so we could both be together and for family to visit. After a few days we got the news that Kelsey and Taneysha had passed away and Glenn got out of hospital a day later, the day before their funerals. I was allowed out of hospital on leave to attend there funerals and was then to return back to have skin grafts done on my foot, After coming home from the funerals I returned to the hospital and had the skin grafts done and 2 weeks later I was able to go home, before I could go home I had to go to fracture clinic for them to put a plaster cast on to keep my foot straight, I had to attend fracture clinic every week from then for them to change the cast and check and make sure the skin graft was going to take. I finally had the cast removed last friday and my foot is still not straight, I have been in and out of A and E with many difficulities since this happened and now I have been put into physio and left to walk on the side of my foot because I can’t walk flat on it.

        "text": "Little did we know that the September 4th quake was just a practice run. The one where we realised Christchurch was not as safe as we had all thought.  Naive in hindsight and the knowledge that this was already known by those who should have taken action earlier to protect the buildings and houses and people has been hard to accept.  We had no idea what was to come.\nBeing dragged awake at dawn almost a year ago by a train noise entering the house was terrifying; being thrown to the ground in my fourth floor office at lunchtime even more so, but I still feel lucky that I wasn’t in many of the other places in the city that caused so many deaths.  It is still hard to visit some of the streets, knowing people lost their lives there.   The hardest part for me was returning to work on the fourth floor.  \nI hope that wherever you live, you realise how isolated we were without power and water, damaged roads, no sewage, scarce petrol and gas.  How little it took to ensure we had light, a radio, spare batteries, food, clean water and access to cars to charge cellphones when we could text again.  The infuriating fact that the whole country knew more about what was happening in full colour than we did and the horror when we eventually made it somewhere with television!  I hope you can look round where you are now and feel some security that you will be ready when it happens.\nAlthough I mainly write about animals, I have also been blogging about the earthquakes since September.

No power water toilets… Looking for candles!!! \nCan’t phone my parents. Worry, stress, fear. People are dead or trapped. Kids all ok. Thankful for being here, home, safe. Hope others are ok too\nIf you click on the earthquake label on the left of the blog, you can pull up all the earthquake posts right back to September.\nI still love Christchurch. As I see the deconstruction happening all around my work,  the large gaps appearing everywhere, I just hope we get to see something positive come out in good time.  In the meantime, the support of the people from within the city has been amazing, and the flood of support from those in New Zealand and overseas has been humbling. Thank you all.\nMy thoughts for all those who lost friends and family, who are living with the uncertainty of the zones, who have been made redundant,  and for all of us facing a different future.",

        "text": "Lyttelton, New Zealand, became our home in 1995. We fell in love with the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape, the historic places and its friendly, tight knit community. Having come from England, I had no experience of earthquakes. My husband’s family lived in the Wellington region, we had spent two holidays with them and toured around the South Island which we recognised as a place where we would like to live. Ironically, back in 1993 I had said that I didn’t want to live in Wellington, because it was situated on a major fault line.\nOn Friday 3rd September 2010 I had spent the best part of the evening baking and preparing for my daughter’s 12th birthday party, at midnight I put the final finishing touches to Lucy’s birthday cake, placed it in a glass-domed cake stand and on top of a large basin of water to protect it from the Lyttelton ‘ant attack’. \nJust over four hours later we were jolted from sleep by violent shaking, crashes and creaking noises identical to those of the Te Papa ‘earthquake simulation house’ except this was in pitch darkness. We scrambled to find the children- I knew we had to get them away from the large central chimney that ran through our 150 year old two-storey cottage. Lucy and I tumbled downstairs to shelter in the living room doorway, while Colin, my husband, called “Where are you?” to our son, who was not in bed, out of the quake noise came Hamish’s answer: “I’m under my desk, of course!”\nThe next 10 minutes in the dark seemed to go on for an eternity while the house was rocked and jolted as if by a giant shaking a baby’s rattle. Our teeth chattered and in a lull I grabbed nearby coats to keep us warm and also our solar torch radio. This light plus the calm voice of a National Radio presenter telling us what was happening and relaying text messages received from around the South Island were reassuring. Hamish flashed the torch around and Lucy said “Oh, no! Look at your clock.” My Westminster chimes clock that had been one of the few possessions that had travelled in my suitcase with me across the world had bounced off the mantelpiece and lay smashed on the ground amongst other debris, “That really doesn’t matter” I replied. As the quakes calmed down and dawn broke we climbed back upstairs; cold and exhausted, all four of us snuggled into our bed- just like the early mornings when the children were little.\nMorning light revealed the destruction of fallen and smashed items, but there in the kitchen the glass-domed birthday cake stood majestic and unscathed, even more miraculous was the news on the radio that no one had been killed.\nI teach the 6 and 7 year olds at Lyttelton Main School. At lunchtime on 22nd February 2011 our Principal released me from playground duty enabling me to take my students for swimming lessons at Lyttelton pool. I had just crossed the junior playground to reach the door of my classroom ready to blow my whistle for ‘line-up-time’ when the ground was jolted beneath my feet; three children (who had been hovering around- eager to go swimming) dived into the classroom and under their desks while everything seemed to explode around us, others were trying to ‘turtle’ down on the ground, which was behaving more like a wild trampoline than asphalt, we were tossed about like Ping-Pong balls. I ‘flew’ in after the three children who had panicked and gone inside; next thing I was in the centre of the playground with two of the children attached to each arm and one clinging around my neck ‘monkey style’.\nHow I got there I don’t remember, but the next day I found my arms, legs, ribs and back were covered with bruises from this.\nThe children were amazingly calm until another huge quake caused a partial collapse of the neighbouring building, the photographers (formerly the Lyttelton Borough Council Chambers); this caused a huge dust cloud to engulf us and set off screaming and cries of ‘fire’ from the children. I wished my arms could stretch telescopically to cuddle them all, we huddled together and all I could do was reassure them it was brick dust, not smoke. Later on, people who had been on London Street told me they would never forget the sound of those children’s screams.\nA head count told me that five of my students were still up at the playing field where they would have been having activities with our ‘Kelly Sports’ tutor. Parents from in port started arriving, one had been in the tunnel when the quake struck and said it had felt like being in a roller-coaster ride.\nI headed up to the ‘grassy’ playing field to see if my other five students were alright and found them all safe along with the wet and bedraggled new entrant children who had been in the swimming pool when the quake had struck. Luckily just a small number had been in the water as our new entrant class is small at the start of the year and our strict student/ adult ratio near water meant there had been plenty of adults to lift them out very quickly. Between the junior school teachers, teacher-aides and parent helpers we safely brought these children back to where the rest of the school were assembled and then Mark Buckley, Lyttelton’s fire chief organised everyone to move to the Lyttelton Recreation Centre car park. Walking there down the centre of Winchester Street seemed surreal; I was focussing on the children and the road ahead when I heard the cry “Oh! Look at St. Joseph’s!” and then I saw that the south facing entrance to the church had completely collapsed.\nLuckily for Lyttelton both the Army and the Navy had been in port and on the hills so they arrived to help as if by a miracle. Lyttel- Piko and the local Supermarket sent food and supplies up to those evacuated to the Rec. centre. Deirdre Holmes, a local homeopath was offering rescue remedies. After a long wait frantic parents started arriving from over the Bridle path. I will always remember the fear on their faces as they arrived in search of their children, many had left the destruction of the central city behind and were imagining the worst as they came over the hill because they had heard “the quake’s centred in Lyttelton and it’s been flattened”. Happily, I received a text from Lucy to say she was safe and going home with a friend who lived close by to her school, an hour later I got a similar message from Hamish. At 5pm, Colin appeared. He had been at work on the fourth floor of Central library when the quake hit. They had evacuated the library to see the Provincial Council Chambers collapse; all Colin’s belongings, including his mobile phone, were in the library. He had walked through the destruction of the central city and over the Bridle Path, only to have to go back over the Bridle path again to reach Hamish and Lucy. A friend had left her car in the Gondola car park so she gave Colin the car keys so he could hopefully drive to our children and return over Dyers pass which we heard was now open.\nBy 6pm I still had a handful of children with me who had not been collected. I had started thinking that if they were not picked up by 7pm I would need to take them home with me. It was ten to seven at night before the last child in my care was reunited with their parents.\nThen I went home, along with one family from school who could not return to their house. At our house, on Coleridge Terrace, the large internal central chimney had collapsed filling Hamish and Lucy’s rooms so high with bricks that you could not open their bedroom doors; the night store heaters had been ripped off the walls and fallen to the floor. The power cable had torn out from our house and was lying across the road and the historic stone walls, pillars and archway that surrounded our house had all collapsed to piles of rubble and there was no running water. Our living room is the one-storey part of the house and only part unaffected by the chimney collapse; this seemed the safest place to be.\nBy the time Colin, Hamish and Lucy got home at 9pm our numbers had swollen to three families- nine people altogether including 2 strangers! It was starting to get dark, so we got out sleeping bags, blankets and duvets and all nine of us settled down for a night on our living room floor- like sardines in a tin. We dozed,  every 10 minutes we were jolted awake by countless aftershocks, images of the day went through my mind, I was thankful that two years previously we had spent our savings on major conservation work on the house including new piles and new wooden sash windows, without this work the house would not have survived. The thick metal plates that attached the house to the new piles had been forced under huge pressure to buckle like liquorice; they were still firmly attached but would need to be replaced.\nThe fortnight that followed was memorable. The sun shone, Lyttelton tunnel was initially closed off, no power or piped water was the daily reality. There was jubilation when the first water tanker arrived on Winchester Street. \nI walked around our shattered streets, looking at the damage our historic town had suffered. Between 2004 and 2005 I had photographed all these buildings as part of my research for Lyttelton to be registered as an Historic Area, I remembered the many conversations I had had with the senior citizens I had interviewed as part of the Lyttelton Community Oral History Project and how many of the destroyed buildings had been part of their lives – the ballroom above Norton’s, the Harbour Light Cinema, Holy Trinity Anglican Church, St Joseph’s Catholic Church, St. John’s Presbyterian Church, the Museum, the Time-ball, all the businesses on the main streets in the town centre. I photographed them all again to help me come to terms with this loss. \nAmongst all the destruction came a stronger community, there was a pooling of resources, neighbours shared barbecues, those who had power and water invited those without to use showers, washing machines, internet and even spa pools! The volunteer fire brigade worked tirelessly, day in day out. Community volunteers rallied around those who needed help. At school the block that included my classroom was red stickered so we had to spend the rest of 2011 teaching in the school hall along with another teacher and her students.\nThe children became remarkably adaptable and were adept at diving under desks or into ‘turtle’ position for the unrelenting aftershocks and then learned to carry on afterwards as if nothing had happened. A supply of cuddly toys which Lucy had outgrown and donated were invaluable, as my arms were not long enough to extend to hug all 25 children after big shakes. \nAs part of “Greening the Gaps” the children in my class enthusiastically dug, planted and watered sunflowers and varieties of seeds into the neighbouring demolition site that had been the photographers. I wonder what they will remember of this when they are adults, I am sure they will become strong and helpful citizens. It is wonderful to watch ‘their earthquake garden’ grow and become our symbol of hope- seeds in a wasteland growing to create a beautiful place.",

Because my husband could scarcely move without a walker, they offered to come home with us to help, thinking that once again Lyttelton would be ok because it was on rock! We persuaded them to go to their home and made it to our own home in St Albans many hours later – I have only vague memory of that nightmare. We crept along the roads, and I tried not to get too close to the car in front as the huge aftershocks were picking up and moving our small car. Holes were opening up in front of us, and as my husband couldn’t walk, I knew we couldn’t do what many people were doing, abandon the car. \nMy cellphone couldn’t get through to family; the thing that had always made me feel so lucky, having all of my kids and grandchildren in and around Christchurch suddenly felt like a nightmare; which ones have I lost this time? as it was obvious there would be loss of life. Amazingly we passed one of our grandsons walking home from polytech, and he knew some of the others were ok. Our daughter was at home with her two sick children, in a very old house that was already damaged. When she couldn’t get hold of us, or her partner, she and the children walked to our house and sat in the back garden waiting to see if we were alright before giving up. I ache to think of what she went through.

Work was much as usual – I think it got windy later that day and so we cancelled the afternoon skydives. I don’t really remember the details. It was sunny. The summer was warm in Wanaka.\nWhat I remember, though, is anxiety that carried through our neighbors’ families that day and for a week afterwards.\nOn the first day they didn’t know whether he’d survived.\n\nOn the second they were told that he’d died.\n\nOn the third they were told that sorry, it couldn’t really be confirmed either way before the autopsy results were published and that was going to take a while longer.\nI don’t remember how long they waited. I think six days, carrying on with their lives but really simply pacing backwards and forwards and simply wanting an answer. Shopping for groceries, having showers, watching the news and knowing that most probably he’d died that day as he’d never been heard from afterwards, but, really, not knowing it for sure.\nAll the while Christchurch families were appearing in Wanaka, kids enrolling in Mt Aspiring College, people opening up their homes and batches for those wanting to get away from it all.\nA mother from Europe calling up our dropzone, asking if we’d possibly had a girl named this-and-this skydive with us – a daughter she hadn’t heard from since two days earlier, all whilst we knew there had been unidentified backpackers at YHA.\nI don’t have much of a story from February 22, 2011. Christchurch, to me, is a city of traffic cones, bumpy roads, broken neighborhoods and soaring (rental) prices. I don’t pang for the buildings that aren’t there – to me it’s just neighborhoods “with nothing there”.\nSo if anything, I re-live and carry the earthquake legacy through the people I’ve met – ones who had much more traumatic experiences from that day, and I listen and nod.\nBut to me, Christchurch isn’t a traumatic city.

It was good to hear her voice, and to be able to get a direct message out to everyone.  At work, our computer system blocks all online email sites, and at that time I don’t think I’d had time to think about posting to my blog.  I’d asked a nephew to drop a line on Facebook, and asked a cousin to do so as well.\nExhausted, we slept better this night, but still not well.  I slightly overslept my intended wake-up time the next morning, and didn’t get out of the house til well after 730am.  Sure enough, it seemed half the city had also awakened ‘early’ in order to get to the petrol pumps, and the lines stretched for blocks.  I continued on toward work, now truly concerned that I would have to wait in line for hours to get petrol, as I had only enough fuel to possibly get back home.  Nearing work, I found another newly-opened petrol station, however, and was able to slide into line.\nI was only about 15th or 20th in line.  Success!\nStill took forever to get to the pump.  Although the radio has repeated messages against panic-buying, it seems noone is listening.  I truly needed petrol; it is doubtful that everyone buying it was in as much need.  Many stations reported selling 4x their normal volume each day, and it was a struggle for incoming tankers to keep the tanks full.  Some stations resorted to selling petrol only to emergency vehicles, to allow them a place to buy fuel without long waits.\nMy husband had stayed home again, in order to keep cleaning the huge mess.  Again, I had hoped to get away early, but ended up working til around 3pm, from memory.  Some of that time was spent with a staff member at the grocery store, buying a few easy-to-prepare meals such as instant potatoes, some fruit, a few drinks, bread, etc.  Ice was already an impossibility.  We had no idea how we would keep things cold at home; our only option would be to keep things at work and take them home each day, or possibly even cook at work and take it home.\nAt the grocery store, some shelves were already emptying.  Again, people were panic-buying.  I only bought enough for a couple days, but some were buying enough food to last a couple weeks or more.  Having lived through this before, you know if you don’t get your bit, someone else will, so it’s hard to resist buying a bit more than you need.\nOur evening was again spent listening to the radio, hearing reports of water tank deliveries, portaloo drop-offs, requests and offers for help, rising body counts, closed roads, etc.  Whereas after September most services were open within a couple days, this time it seemed it would be at least Monday before things such as banks, etc. opened.  Although the local newspaper, The Press, has been delivered most (or all) days, the mail has not yet resumed.\nI went to bed early this night, as I was freezing cold, no doubt made worse by my level of weariness.",

        "text": "22 February 2011  \nIt was an ordinary day. I had a day off work and was watching the Food Channel to get me in the mood for lunch. All of a sudden, the room juddered. The water sloshed in the fish tank. I gave it a few seconds to stop, then got up and walked to the sliding door to get out. It was locked, so I took a few seconds to do my best stunned mullet impersonation, and with the room still shaking strongly, I went to hold the TV to stop it falling over. \nI knew it was a decent-sized aftershock, but I didn’t know where it was centred or how big. While I waited for the TV and internet to catch up, there was a text from my younger two son’s school saying everyone was OK, but the kids were scared. Could parents please pick them up? Radio Live was in the car, talkback radio, as the calls came pouring in, I started to realise that it might be a bad one. \nI arrived at the school to the kids sitting on the netball courts, a bit like sports day, but with the sound of sobbing. My 6-year-old ran up, holding his shoes, a big smile on his face. “Are you taking me home? Can we ask my friend over?”. Then my 10-year-old appeared, grinning. “That was AWESOME” he said. We had no idea at that point that our city was in ruins. \nBack home, I got a call from my husband. He’d been waiting at the traffic lights in Riccarton at the time and thought he’d got a flat tyre. Then he saw the car in front rocking from wheel to wheel, and watched as the streetlights flexed in a wave that reached the traffic lights, making them smash together. That’s when the walls started tumbling on the buildings around him. \nI drove to Rangiora to pick up my 13-year-old son from high school. The high school kids were on the rugby pitch, laughing and talking. A cheer went up when the guy with the loud speaker said that those who could walk home could go. My son said that when the quake hit, he had just started science class. A pen had fallen off the table. \nMy 13-year-old couldn’t understand why another student who was listening to the radio on headphones, was crying. I told him that there had been a lot of damage in the city, that they thought people would have died this time. Looking pale, he asked whether his Dad and his two friends that go to school in the city were OK. I reassured him that they would be fine, but in my mind I pictured the old brick building across from the Arts Centre where his Dad would probably be, the school in Cashel Mall where his friends were.  Thankfully, we heard they were all OK by the end of the day. \nBack at home, we sat glued to the TV for the next two days. Friends from Brooklands came to stay – they had no power or water. We watched agape, along with the rest of New Zealand and most of the world, the destruction a few seconds of strong shaking – over twice the force of gravity in places – had wrought to our city. A landscape, so familiar just a few days before, turned into an unrecognisable war zone. \nAnd so the slow, hard process to recovery began. Normality is warped for many. Our city, where we shop, dine, dance, have our eyes, teeth and accounts sorted, is under a heap of old bricks. \nPhysically, the only damage on our property suffered is a bigger crack in the concrete. We hare very, very lucky and we know it. Yet the earthquakes – the memories, the uncertainty, the adrenalin rush at every rumble – have become embedded in our psyche.\nLife will never be the same in Christchurch. But it will go on.",

        "text": "22nd February 2011. I was standing in the kitchen doing the dishes and talking to my 15 month old son who was behind me on floor playing with some pots and pans. I heard the familiar sound of an aftershock coming I stood there for a second wondering if it was going to get bigger or not. It got bigger, the water from the sink was coming out in waves and landing on the floor, everything in the kitchen cupboards was falling out almost on top of my son, I turned and tried to pick him up but I slipped on the wet floor, I got up and tried again, I fell over again this time landing hard on my knees, once more I got up and fell over I then gave up and crawled to my son, he was sitting there on the floor arms stretched out to me, screaming with a look of absolute horror on his face, I grabbed hold of him and huddled over him protecting him from falling objects. I started screaming “stop please just stop” It eventually did, It was the longest 20 seconds of my life. I went to get up off the floor and noticed a lot of blood, I started to cry and rip the clothes of my son trying to find the source of the blood, thankfully it wasn’t him, I then noticed a cut on my hand and thought thank god it is just me bleeding. I picked my son up and went outsdie to the front lawn, my sister from next door came over and asked if I was ok I said yes I just have a small cut, she looked at it and said thats not a small cut, I said too bad there is not much I can do about it. She went back into her house and was looking for her first aid kit, I told her not to worry just go pick your son up from school. Another neighbour from up the street gave me some fresh water to wash my hand and I tied a flannel around it. I sat on my front lawn with my son waiting for my sister to get back from school, while waiting another man from up the street pulled his car over and offered to bandage my hand, I was very grateful. My sister finally arrived home, we decided to put our tents up in the back yard as we had no power or water again and there was broken glass all through the house, we knew this quake had been much worse than the September one. I tried to call my husband but my cell phone died as I was dialling, my husband finally arrived home 3 hours later after abandoning the car and wading through knee deep water to get home. He asked if we were ok, I said yes, he then asked what was wrong with my hand so I showed him it, he said I should have it looked at seeing as I was pregnant at the time (I had forgotten about the pregnancy up until then), I rung up healthline as it was the only number that wasn’t overloaded and they told me to try and make my way to sanitarium in Papanui, I explained to them that we were in Aranui and were pretty much trapped due to water and liquefaction, they said that was all the advice they could give. We got in the car and decided to try and make it to Papanui, it was all ok until we got around the corner to the Anzac Drive bridge, there was a gap of at least 30 cm where part of the bridge had sunk, I told my husband to turn back and not worry but he decided to risk driving over the bridge, I couldn’t believe the destruction along Anzac Drive and Travis Road, but as we got closer to Papanui driving down qe2 drive it was almost as if we had driven to another city the damage was minimal compared to the devastation we had driven through. We made it to sanitarium and was seen promptly by a doctor, I needed stitches and was given antibiotics, I was not allowed a tetanus because it is not safe during pregnancy. The doctors then listened for a heartbeat from baby thankfully they found it, I thought something might have happened to the baby when I fell on floor. We then drove home but the Anzac Drive bridge was closed and the only bridge open was the Wainoni Rd one we waited in traffic for 45 minutes just to get across the river. The next week passed in a bit of a blur, we slept in the tent and cooked on the bbq, we had our neighbours over for tea because the meat in the freezer was defrosting fast with no power. We had no sewerage and had to dig a long drop in the back yard until chemical toilets were dropped off several weeks later. I also had to make a 3 hour round trip daily to Papanui to have my dressing changed, despite this I got an infection and had to go to the hospital to have my wound cleaned out and receive IV antibiotics, they also prescribed me some more oral antibiotics but the challenge was trying to find a pharmacy that was open, the closest one to me was in Papanui. It was difficult to avoid infection because of the living conditions, and during the second week after the quake I decided it was getting too hard to live like this with a 15 month old, being pregnant and injured so I loaded up the car and went to stay with relatives in Nelson. My husband stayed at home to look after the house. I stayed in Nelson for 2 weeks, and returned once water and power had been restored. Life on the eastside of Christchurch was not easy we had to travel to Riccarton or Papanui just to do the grocery shopping because everything on this side of town was closed even now 7 months later things are only just starting to get back to normal.",

My chair, which had wheels, rolled back and forward across the floor.  My hairdresser grabbed it, and I grabbed the shelf that was attached to the floor in front of my and held on.  One of the hairdressers screamed then ran out through the door, down the tiled corridor and out to the rear carpark.  \nWe could hear yells, screams and glass smashing in the Fresh Choice supermarket in the Merivale Mall across the road.   People staggered out into the middle of Papanui Road.  One man paced up and down the footpath outside the hairdressers.  He looked at his phone, above his head, then ducked and held his head with both hands as the next, smaller quake struck.  He ran into the middle of the road, and paced around in circles.  Other people staggered out from the main mall onto the street.  The panic subsided into a nervous murmur.  \n“Wow” someone said.\n\n“Power is still on” said someone else. \n\n“I’ll check the water” said my hairdresser.  “Who wants to go outside?”\n\nEveryone who wanted to go already had. The cell phone lines were already overloaded.   \nMy first thought was “Where is Matt?”, my 14 year old son.  He had gone with friends to the Riccarton Mall.  I didn’t like the idea of him being surrounded by panicked people in a big open space.  I asked to use the salon phone and called home.  Both Matt and Terry were there.\n“What would you like to do?” the hairdresser asked.\n\n“Well, if the water is on, I would like the dye in my hair rinsed out” I said.  “We probably have enough time before the next large aftershock”.\n\nOne client had a photo sent to her on her phone which showed the cliffs at Sumner as a cloud of dust.  Another client checked GeoNet.  \n\n“Magnitude 5.8.” she said “Just offshore”.\n\n“It was a very rolly quake” said my hairdresser.\n\n“There’ll be another large shock too” I said “but let’s hope it’s smaller”.\n\n“Would you like to go outside?” she asked again.\n\n“I don’t like the thought of walking down that tiled corridor with floor to ceiling glass the entire way during the next quake” I said.  “I don’t want to risk falling down, and I can’t see that anything can fall on me here”.\n\n“That glass has survived bigger quakes than that” she nodded.  \n\n“I feel safer sitting down inside than I would standing around outside.  Besides, my family is safe.  Do you still want to cut my hair?”\n\n“If you are happy sitting here, I will check on my staff, and we can go from there” she said.\nThe girl who had run outside had been in the City during the February quake, and had her building collapse around her.  Understandably, she was nowhere to be found. \n A woman came in from the supermarket to sit with her daughter who was also waiting for a haircut.  She sat down in a chair next to me.  It was clear from her eyes that was in shock.  Chocolates were passed around.\n\n“I was in the supermarket” she eventually announced.  “I leaned against the wall and watched all of the glass falling off the shelves.  I was worried that the shelves might fall down, but they didn’t.  People were screaming and trying to get out of the supermarket all at once”.  \n\n“Strange isn’t it?” I said “That weird lull between quakes, like everything holding its breath”.\n\nThe little girl had her hair cut.\nAfter she re-stacked the shampoo displays that had fallen on the floor, my hairdresser returned.\n\n“Right” she said.  “Let’s see how we go”.\n\nHalf way through the cut, a more violent quake struck.  This time, the hairdresser gripped my shoulders, and I held on to the shelf again as my chair and the earth rolled back and forth.  The sound was enormous.  The ground shook up and down very rapidly and went on for longer than the prior quake.\n\nA detached part of my mind watched the panes of glass move about 5cm back and forth.    I looked up.  The ceiling panels did not seem to be moving.  That didn’t make sense. It took me a while to figure out that I was moving and the ceiling was too.  \n\n“I am sweating” I told the hairdresser “That was a big quake!”\n\n“I’m glad I’m sitting down” I said. “I thought we would get smaller quakes, not bigger ones!” \n\nAftershocks were always smaller than the original quake, so this was a new fault being created.\n“I’m just about finished your cut” my hairdresser announced, “but I just need to check where my staff are.  Do you want to stay or to go?”\n\n“Crikey” I said, “are you sure you want to finish?  Look at my hands – they are shaking!”\n\n“If you are happy to stay, I will finish the haircut, as it won’t be long” she said.  I am pretty sure that we will have no more clients today, and I have to stay to close up the shop”.\n\n“Sure, no problem” I said.\n\nShe soon came back and finished cutting.  She began to blow dry my hair.\n\n“You don’t need to do that” I said.\n\n“Well, I need to see how it sits, and it looks like there is still a bit of weight to come out on this side” she quickly thinned my hair.  “But I won’t straighten it”.\n\n“Well, what kind of service is that?” I joked, and we laughed.\n\nThe power and water remained on, so I was able to pay by EFTPOS.\n“That is the last haircut from me” my hairdresser announced “as I start my new job in Auckland in three weeks.  “I can recommend another hairdresser in this salon” she said.  \n\nThis woman was going to get top marks for professionalism.  I wish I could write her a reference.\n\n“That’s very nice, but I won’t make the appointment now, though, if you don’t mind” I said.\n\nI gave her a hug goodbye.  She had been trying to tame my hair for years.",

Hubby and I had spotted just the right combination of flights available for booking with reward flights to get our little family (2 adults, 1 child) to NZ in November, but we hadn’t gotten round to booking them yet. My visa had finally come round, but the timing of our actual departure was still a choice between October and November.\nSo around midday I said I was taking a longer lunch for some reason, dashed home, and booked the flights. One way, non-refundable, mid-November. Then I went back to work and handed in my notice. No turning back now!\nAnd then a few hours later I was sharing our now-definite plans with friends on Facebook, when hubby’s mum – in Chch – posted something along the lines of “BLOODY GREAT EARTHQUAKE!” \nThat was all we heard for a while, and to be honest we had no idea whatsoever how bad it was until watching that evening’s news. Not that there had been any updates, power and phonelines being out at all. MiL’s post was only there because as an insomniac she had been wiling the wee hours away in front of the computer.. then cowering under a doorframe.\nWhile we didn’t experience that quake, it really did shake us. Our resignations could probably be retracted, but those flights would be harder, and we’d been struggling for close to a year to get my partnership visa approved due to medical history.\nIn the end we landed in Chch on 15/11/11 anyway. Lightening only strikes once, right? Heh.",

        "text": "I was preparing to teach an orientation programme to new students, sitting at a desk by a plate glass window in the Laidlaw Library. \nWhen the quake struck I thought of ducking under the desk but decided that I’d be sprayed by shards of glass if the window went so I started to run between shelves. Books were falling all around me but I made it to the door and stood under the frame while the shaking continued.\nWhen it had finished I went to check if the others were OK. Kathy was standing in her doorway and there was a massive bookcase fallen onto the desk where she normally sits. She said- “that one was bigger than last year’s quake.” \nI immediately thought of my husband and son who were meant to have been in the CBD. I couldn’t reach my husband on the cell phone but I got through to my son. \n“We’ve been told to wait in the CPIT carpark” he told me. I assured him that I’d get there as soon as I could, but there might be some issues with the CBD so I couldn’t say how long it would take.\nAs I drove down Papanui Road I got a really bad feeling. There were people standing by letterboxes looking distressed. I thought, “people will have died in this one.” \nI saw the Merivale shops with all the facades thrown onto the streets and the shop interiors exposed as if they were doll’s houses with the fronts taken off them.\nAs I turned the corner into Bealey Ave there were already people taking the initiative and directing traffic away from a brick building on a lean and crumbling. \nI hit traffic and crawled up Bealey Avenue- frantically calling my family to see if they were all right. My husband and school son couldn’t be reached. My daughter was OK and told me my son-in-law was in Lyttelton dodging falling masonry. \nIt wasn’t until I was in that snarl up of traffic with ambulances behind, unable to move, that I realised I was part of the problem preventing help getting to people. I ditched the car under a tree and decided to hitch hike up Barbadoes Street. \nThe woman who dropped me near CPIT promised to pick us both up when she had looped back around to Fitzgerald Avenue. My son was the last one waiting in the car park. He had been at a desk when the earthquake hit and immediately ducked under it while the computer beside him fell- but the only injury he had was some carpet burn.\nThe trip home took five hours. Dan and I walked past chasms in the road with trucks buried in them, bridges sunk and tilting, waded through liquefaction puddles and saw broken buildings everywhere. Periodically we were rocked by aftershocks and Dan was amused when I knelt down with each one. \nWe never met the woman I hitch hiked with again and I realised later it was because the phone towers were failing and the text I sent her was delayed by hours. \nWe picked up the car and drove for a while till trapped again in traffic, then ditched the car, hitched from East to West Christchurch and finally found people driving to North Canterbury who we could hitch with.\n\nFive hours later I was home safe. My husband hadn’t answered his texts because he had left his cell phone in his classroom when the class evacuated.\n I keep thinking about how we got off lightly. After every subsequent aftershock I felt angry at the distress being caused. The earthquakes became an unpredictable enemy to many and I felt powerless to protect Canterbury from them.",

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Trent Hiles conducted shortly after the 22 February 2011 earthquake.\nMy name is Trent Hiles and I am 47. When the earthquake hit I probably was 500 metres up in the air landing from a flight from Auckland into Christchurch airport.  We approached, we landed and we were taking a long time to get out of the plane and nobody knew what was going on and then the pilot came on and said “Folks just to let you know there might have been a wee earthquake, there is a bit of stuff around the terminal, it’s not poor house keeping it’s  a few things that have fallen off.  So make your way out of the plane and you will be directed out of the terminal.”\nSo we got out of the plane, and I wasn’t worried at all. There were people on the plane from Auckland just to do business for the day and they looked worried “Oh, an earthquake!” but I said “No, no, it’ll be sweet!” – sort of thing.  Then we walked out of the airbridge and there is sirens going off, there are fire engines, police, there’s stuff fallen off the ceilings, stuff broken off the walls, and I am thinking straight away “This is not just a small earth quake,” \nAnd I was walking out towards the international terminal we were directed through and my cell phone rang and it was my Dad and he said “Oh, there has been a massive earthquake.” and I said ‘Yeah, I know” and this huge aftershock happened and all this stuff fell out of the big glass atrium, just dust and bits and pieces, nothing major. And I just thought ’Expletive I don’t want to be in here.” and I shot off outside.  \nI had already keyed in with Fiona to get the kids from school, they’re in Opawa, I got the last bus out of the air port.  Crawled through the first part of the city. Finally the bus got gridlocked and I ran to the Steiner School to pick up the kids. We had co-ordinated that I get the kids, she was trying to come and meet me at a place we had already pre-determined ages ago, that if we’d have an emergency we’ve got some friends just below the Rapaki track. \nSo we walked from the school to Vernon terrace and met up and made a plan from there. Fiona worked in Lincoln, and the shake had been quite mild there. She was going to get back to work, but it kept on shaking and then she turned on the radio and went on geo-net and discovered that all hell had broken loose. It was far less damaged out there than the first quake. \nI was thinking about this today: The kids experienced this terrifying earthquake, for the people in Lyttelton it must have been really traumatic, and I missed it. So I feel I’ve missed out in a way! It’s ironic. \nFiona took the boys out to Halswell where we have some friends out there whose house was without power but was safe and secure and I just had this desire to get home. We had our dog here and I was really keen to get over here and see that the power was OK, the water’s off, gas, no issues around that.  And just that proprietorial thing about coming back to my castle. I guess in hindsight, considering that Owen was killed, doing what I was doing, coming up over the hills and down the track I wouldn’t do it again. I saw a number of people coming up and over and I think we had this homing pigeon like thing going on, coming home to roost and making sure that everything is OK.    \nWhen the cell phones came back on line I managed to talk to Fiona and she decided they weren’t any better off over there than here so they drove over the Sign of the Kiwi, which probably wasn’t the wisest thing to do with all the rockfalls, but it was good to come home and be together .\nI’ve always known, call it intuition or statistically, that there was going to be a big earthquake. I used to work in the middle of town, at Unlimited School, and I left there in 2007, and one of the reasons, but it wasn’t the driving one, was that I knew that one day there was going to be an earthquake and I didn’t want to be in the city center in a five story concrete, steel and glass structure. We don’t have to live our work like this in this country, so I made choices around that. \nThere had been changes already from the first earthquake, but I always had the respect for the Planet and the power of Papatuanuku. We are here by her grace. We survive because everything works at the moment, but it will not always work and hasn’t always worked…\nI met with someone today and we talked about earthquakes and it might sound crazy but its like… it’s actually good. This is a good thing to be happening because it gives us a reality check how we are living out lives. Are we awake to what we are doing to the planet, to each other, to ourselves? I am not saying I live the perfect live by any stretch of imagination but to have an awareness that we live in a fragile, precarious time- that’s all time, not just now. And we are so fortunate to live in this country away from all the stuff that is happening in the Northern hemisphere, – yet maybe too fortunate. We’ve become too used to being too comfortable,-  a little bit more of an egalitarian society,  equalling things out,  taking from the rich and giving to the poor, a bit of Robin Hood stuff. \nDo we need to have so much stuff? I’ve seen a lot of stuff thrown out because people go ‘Phhht’ what does this mean to me? Nothing, I have stored it for so many years.’  Sooo, I don’t think any major changes for me, but that reminder ‘Am I awake?” and ‘Yes, I think I am.’ \nCan I in a way – and that’s maybe also what it is with Arts in the Park, – what can I do to nurture that awakenness in people. Because you can’t tell them to wake up. They’ve got to explore that and find it for themselves. But you can do things to trip them up, to have them stop and consider what is going on.  \nAnd we haven’t run away… and where would you run? Run to Auckland and being blown away and blown down [by hurricanes]. And Motueka and Nelson have also been shaken by earthquakes, so in New Zealand you can’t run. So let’s stay and fight, demonstrate to our kids and the community resilience, that’s a great lesson.  \nWe all know about the strength of our own community here, and that has re-inforced that, so there were no surprises.  Needing to get together and connect with people, by and large Lytteltonians talk to their neighbour, we’re not aloof and curse each other over the fence. For me it’s about opportunity.  The positive thing is – yes, we’ve lost stuff, and we’ve all lost something-, some people have lost homes and people. The buildings are gone, but with destruction comes creation.   \nChristchurch is going to be a nightmare to sort it out, but we could actually be the model in a small scale of how it should be done. It will be interesting to see what leadership comes out of the Lyttelton community, there is still something to happen with that, and I sent an email through following that community meeting down at the Rec. Center and said we almost need an informal mayor of the Harbour Basin area, who can not necessarily have all the ideas, but bring the people together and unite all the different thoughts and ideas.\nI am not saying all the  buildings have to look exactly the same but that there is a cohesive redevelopment that allows everyone to have a say and yet moves the process along. Who that person could be I have no idea. Maybe someone will step forward… once the buildings are down, we have a blank slate almost, what can we do now? Of course most people will be keen to get the building started as soon as possible. Would be good to get the businesses talking to each other. And the fact it’s not just the businesses. I work with the Whakaraupo carving center,- how can we bring those outreach groups closer to become part of their community? They are very keen to tap in top the tourist  market. What can we be doing with the community, the Port Company and other people to capitalise on what’s going to be a critical source of income for us, if we can get Lyttelton going, and give people a good reason to come here. If they can come to the Harbour Basin and can have a one day cultural experience or artistic adventure they will come. That’s the sort of stuff I think needs to happen and that is positive in my eyes. \nIt’s positive to see the willingness of people to open their homes to friends or even strangers to come and live with them till things got sorted out… Just re-inforcing the community sense we have here is a model for other communities across the hill, who made inroads into those sort of things they probably didn’t have going on before. \nLindon Puffin said that for him the big thing was that Lyttelton was such a strong community but maybe we as a community should be going out to other communities and almost show them the way or help them build their own communities. Tell them you don’t have to wait for a major earthquake to become close to your neighbours. It’s like having the Timebank and Project Lyttelton. We are blessed by the geographic nature of this particular part of this country and so our community has formed naturally if you like, so we have to give thanks to the way the land has formed here, because it is harder on the flat land of Christchurch where everything is more spread out and the boundaries of the communities are less clear. \nThis transcript is from one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton.  We are very grateful to Bettina and the interviewees for allowing their interview transcripts to be posted on QuakeStories.",

        "text": "This is a transcript of an interview with Paul Murray where he describes the 4 September 2010 earthquake .\nI am 40 years old and I live in Sumner. \n\nMy main bedroom is like a vintage sitting room, full of antiques: it got an old piano, with 100 year old glass oil lamps on it, ticking clocks, book shelves, ornaments, glasses, old bottles, old radios, everything.  So I could hear everything –  tinkle, tinkle, rattle, rattle, – so I knew what was going on.  ‘this is an earthquake, this is an earthquake.’   But then when it changed and went ‘shake shake-BANG- shake-shake- CRASH! I went ‘’This is serious, I gotta get  up!’\nAnd then, earlier in the year we had the tsunami warning, and we all got sent up the hill,  this time we thought, well it was an earthquake, I don’t know what’s going on, but we gotta get out.  We instantly packed the car, including the dog . My house is directly opposite the fire station, and the firemen were there at 4.30, doors open, lights on, ready to go. And so we said “Shall we panic, what’s going on, shall we go up the hill?” and he said  “I don’t know about any tsunami warning, but it wouldn’t be a silly idea.”  And we were  up the hill in 10 minutes, to the Summit Road. There was a whole bunch of cars already there, all thinking the same thing.  We turned the radio on till we heard there was no tsunami warning and then we came back down.  \nThere were three of us in the flat and everyone had a different response. One of my flatmates immediately started making food, dehydrating bananas, packing all this dried food and cooking for three days straight – that was her response. \nThe days after were kind of funny, I couldn’t go to work, I couldn’t go to my dance classes, but I also didn’t feel like doing anything. Things I normally do I didn’t want to do any of them: I didn’t feel like putting on music, I didn’t feel like doing any dance practice,  I didn’t feel like doing circus stuff, I didn’t feel like gardening, I didn’t feel like exercising, just kind of sat around. And from what I’ve gathered that’s what a lot of people did through the aftershocks, just sitting around, not knowing what to do with themselves.  \nIt was great to come over to Lyttelton to do some work. It was great being busy. Just the week before I started working with Jules from the Timebank doing a couple of  paid days cause there was so much work to do.  So I just started knowing  some of the systems  when Wham! \nJules rang up and said “Can you just come and do some voluntary hours, whatever, just come! We need help.”  So I said “Yep, of course!’ and I turned up and I didn’t know what I was going to be doing. The first couple of days were absolutely mad. The main issues was dealing with chimneys, because even if they were not down yet they would come down with the aftershocks. Preventing more danger,  thinking about water, because some people did have water at this point, some didn’t. So there was collecting and gathering water and storing water, and delivering it if need be. Then the Medical Centre wanted us to connect with all the elderly patients over 75 initially, and then the next day over 65, just to make sure they are fine, do they need anything, do they have water, do they need repairs doing – whatever. \nSo all those things were going on – there were phones ringing,  there were messages being left,  there were emails coming through, I had my cell phone going, I had the Timebank phone going, I had Jules’ cell phone in front of me while Jules organised chimneys and stuff. So we kind of divvied up jobs: she was  doing mostly  chimneys, I was doing the Medical Centre. So I was trying to find people to call  the patients for the Medical Centre. We had about 200 names to contact. So anybody I could get I was given 10 names each. \nBut all the time I was answering the phones, so every job took a long time to do. I was writing down  messages on all these scraps of paper, there were chimneys and people saying ‘Hi, I can help, what do you need? .” and I was saying “Great, put your name on that list.” and then someone else, and then someone else arrived saying “Yes, I can call patients.” so I gave them 10 names… and then finally after 3 days it all calmed down.  But then we had the big aftershock on Wednesday and we had to contact all the patients again, because more damage was done.\nI can’t really describe how I felt in this first week, but it is kind of like when you have water and sand in a jar and you give it a good shake, the big stuff falls first, but it takes a long time for that water to settle back down again. I felt like in a bit of a trance. It unsettled all sorts of things, I made all these life decisions, it changed my future plans and what I was doing with my life, all sorts of things opened up – like a crack in an earthquake. \nI feel a bit more settled now, but quite hesitatingly so, it felt quite nice to have this suspended time where everything just stops, and you can reconstruct everything however you want it, literally, just like the city I guess. \nOver the last few years I have been doing quite a bit of talking about sustainable living, be it organic gardening or having solar power or living off the land. So the earthquake was really an interesting test run, in how I fared when all the systems were down, how was I coping and how ready was I. I wasn’t at all.  I wasn’t scared because I knew the systems were going to come back up, I knew the power and water would come back on. But it just reminded me again, “Yeah, that’s right, it’s really important to be ready and I am not.”  And just a few days ago I went camping, and got totally snowed in and had to get rescued again. My car didn’t cope, I didn’t have enough clothing – same message again! -\n So this is changing for me: I made a bit of a list of the things I should be getting: making sure I got a decent torch, good gumboots, a transistor radio, saving for a little stove so that I will be able to cook for a whole week if I need to, my old stove wasn’t really good enough. \nThis interview is one of a series of interviews carried out by Bettina Evans of Project Lyttelton .

        "text": "I had flown to Christchurch from Auckland (where I have lived the past 4 years) on 3rd February to await the birth of my first grandchild, a boy and first child for my daughter and her husband.   By 22 February, he was already 10 days overdue and I had moved my plane ticket home  to Auckland forward twice already as I wished to remain in Christchurch for his birth.  \nMy daughter Jessica and her husband Hamish were driving to Christchurch Women’s Hospital to have their baby induced when the 6.3 earthquake struck the city. They managed to get to Christchurch Women’s hospital but it was a scene of panic and confusion including a toddler being triaged on the floor on the foyer of Christchurch Women’s.  It seems he had some masonry or similar fall on him. I don’t know how he fared :-/ \nMeanwhile, I was back at Jess and Hamish’s townhouse – they own the rear townhouse of a block of 6 and I got in to Jess’s car outside their garage a minute before the earthquake hit.  I had begun to back out in to the main area of the asphalt driveway when the car started to lurch violently backwards and forwards and then side to side and ridiculously I just thought maybe I had the handbrake on and had my foot too far down on the accelerator. At this point I saw the neighbour’s car which was parked right next to Jess’s come closer and closer but it was Jess’s car being bounced (with me in it) towards it then bounced back again. My heart was racing and i felt sick with confusion. I looked up at the second storey of the townhouses and they were twisting side to side and swaying backwards and forwards. I then looked at the ashphalt driveway and it was just like waves of licquorice straps… it was only then I realised it was an earthquake – the car tyres turning in to bouncing balls. \nI waited until the worst of the movement had abated but the aftershocks were hell scary. I got out of the car not knowing where to go and stood in the middle of the driveway, tried to phone my daughter and son in law but couldn’t get through. Phoned my partner in Auckland who told me to get back to the house and stand in the porchway. Heart pounding and feeling sick and scared witless of further quakes I opened their door:  to find this\nOnly a few minutes earlier, I had been sitting on the sofa by the baby bouncer and would have had the 75 litre aquarium smash on me if I was still there. Thank god I had decided to pop to my parents house instead and was sitting in the car at least. I was standing transfixed not knowing what to do… a text came through from Jess stating that she and Hamish were on their way home… obviously no inductions for babies would be done that day! I started to receive texts from family members – aunt and uncle’s house in Cashmere was uninhabitable… most the bricks fell off it and inside damaged but they were fine. Couldn’t get through to my elderly parents, they had cell phones but don’t text and their phone batteries were flat. Their landline was not analog but cordless and relied on power (it was 8 hours before we knew they were ok). There was no power or water. \nI phoned my partner in Auckland again as just a voice to hear and a strong aftershock hit. I could hear the roar first and then it hit, i just screamed – it was so terrifying but at least he was on the phone with me – the first time he’s heard an earthquake over the phone!\nJess and Hamish got home 30 minutes later. What is normally around a 10 minute trip took 40 minutes to their house in Addington. Poor Jess, coming home to such a mess and still heavily pregnant. We got stuck in and cleaned it up but of course the carpet sopped up the 75 litres of water and although we sponged as much we could it was impossible getting much more than 3 litres of it in a bucket (it dried out in the following week with dehumidifier on – they got power back on 9 hours later) and not to mention the tiny shards of glass throughout the living area [now replaced with new carpet]. \nA massive aftershock hit as we were trying to clean it all up and Jess and i were thrown against her lounge wall. We just hugged each other terrified for the time it happened. Their bedroom was also a mess with chest of drawers and television tipped up and broken… but they got off lightly – couple of cracks in the exterior cladding of house and their patio concrete cracked. \nWe still had not heard from my brother (who worked for one of the essential services) and his wife. Down the track it transpired that he was just outside the road tunnel working.  He looked up to see the boulders and rocks falling down in to Heathcote Valley.  His wife was at the Palms Mall and terrifyingly had glass falling down around her and her daughter – my niece – who pushed her out of the way when a large shard falling towards her which ended up slicing the leg of a woman near her. (Again makes me thankful I was sitting in the car even if it was bouncing around!) I so feel for my brother who had to help clear a body in a 4wd vehicle from outside his work … nothing was higher than the wheels and other ghastly sights.\nMy parents were physically fine. My ex husband managed to get to their house in his 4wd vehicle and check on them. Jess and I went early the next morning to attempt to get to their street in Avondale – one of the severest hit areas (and since, they have been designated in the red zone). It was such a damn scary drive and i was scared if we stayed out too long it would be our luck she came in to labour and couldn’t get to hospital! We had to park in Avondale Road – the roads had deep potholes and liquefaction was everywhere. We carefully walked through all the mud and water to my parents house.  They had sat up scared all night in the kitchenette. (Their house was severely damaged in the September 4th earthquake and now of course has sustained much more damage.) \nJess heard from her midwife on the Thursday afternoon following the quake, 24th and had a couple of hours only to prepare for a second chance at inducing Joseph. We went up to Christchurch Women’s hospital that night, but had to go back to hospital at 7.30am the next day to get things really going – gorgeous little Joseph David MCBREARTY,  8 pound 6 ounces and 55 cm was born 25 February 2011 by emergency caesarian and i became a ‘Grammy’. He was a media star not long after birth!! – see Baby Joseph a light among earthquake chaos\nFor the couple of weeks following Joseph’s birth, I stayed with my elderly parents in Avondale to ensure they were fine.  It was two weeks all up after the quake before they got power and water back on to their house – they were in one of the hardest hit areas. The house that i still own in Wainoni also received further damage to the previous damage in the Boxing Day quake. A couple of quake epicentres were only metres away, but even though cracks had opened up the driveway and backyard and the house had some tiles shake loose, foundation and pile damage, fence, wall & ceiling damage – the house is structually sound. My employer was exceedingly understanding during this horrendous time and allowed me the precious time with my family in Christchurch to ensure not only that they are doing ok but that i also had the time for my own mental health to feel better about returning to Auckland and leaving them. I am sincerely indebted. Being the family historian/genealogist, I have spent the time since the quakes crying for what my home town has lost, what my family history has lost or had damaged:\n\nMy parents married in St Pauls Presbyterian Church, Cashel St in 1959. It has gone.\nMy Great grandparents married in the Knox Church in 1910 – now a shell.\nGreat great aunts & uncles were baptised at St Luke’s, Manchester street in the 1800’s – demolished no doubt. \nMy GGG Grandparents are buried at St Peter’s, Riccarton – some damage.\nMy aunt & uncle married in the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament & i was bridesmaid in 1978 – it’s now crippled and now uncertain future.\n\nOur local cemeteries have been badly damaged: Linwood; Barbadoes Street; Bromley – I have ancestors lying in all of these and am a volunteer researcher for “The Friends of Linwood Cemetery”.\nI have felt honoured and priviledged to have been part of the incredible outpouring of community not just local but New Zealand wide. I’ve cried for the loss of New Zealanders and internationals alike – i, like many others know of people that have have loved ones and friends die. My gratitude and deep appreciation go out to all those who have helped in search and rescue and keeping us and property feeling secure and safe; bringing us power and water not just back to homes but ensuring a good supply is accessible at points around the city. To people like Tim Baker, City Councillor – salt of the earth and someone who has embraced his local community of Aranui by providing a clothes washing service [who has also written in depth about the heritage and history of the local area and is also a local land agent] and whom was on the 40th Reunion Committee of Aranui High School in 2000 alongside myself. The wonderful uplifting people from Timaru who helped my son and myself shovel the silt from my parents back yard and the people from student army, Coalgate and Loburn who helped shovel out their driveway, words are just not enough but thank you so so soooo very much from the depths of my heart. The difference it made to my parents just to see the bulk of it gone was something special.\nTo my awesome 25 year old son who lives in South Canterbury THANK YOU for thinking of his grandparents (my parents) and making up the lovely sandwiches, providing another gas cooker and containers of water, travelling to help me move the silt then after that travelling to Lincoln later that night to see your newborn nephew then having to drive all the way back home down South. A very special person. \nI’d like to mention my fabulous cousin Clare :) xx who also had a harrowing time during all this due to the fact she lives right atop of Lyttelton and has been evacuated and returned to her home several times due to rock falls and also having to support her parents through all this when their own home in Cashmere was severely damaged has instigated the Trust for children with head injuries in the name of 8 month old Jayden Harris who died in the quake after a television fell on him.   \nAt time of writing (31 July 2011) I am coping mostly ok although sorting through some stressing issues with my insurance company and a real estate company, my former property manager who have not made my life easy. I am at the Ombudsman/media stage with them.  I have really down moments and i have high moments.  I have ‘quake brain’ at work but they understand –  and that’s the main thing :o) – and i’m in Auckland!  I have baby Joseph to dote over who is now 5 months, has 2 teeth and is eating solids\nI am a born and bred Cantabrian always will be.  To the people of the badly hit areas of Christchurch … I feel for you, those aftershocks are so disconcerting and sickening – I hope you get some peace soon and some security in your life. Especially my special special family & extended family xxxx",

        "text": "Disrupted lives – living with earthquakes. Diary entries from 2-4 July 2011\nSaturday 2nd July – today it did not shake – not once!  I went to Smiths Mitre 10 and bought some seismic wax, some candles and some super glue.  Today I would start mending the treasured broken objects from the June 13th quake.  Objects of beauty collected from around the world over many years.  I set them all out with the pieces I have been able to locate.  The wooden giraffe from Johannesburg, the colourful porcelain and stuffed doll from France but given to me in Seattle, and the Guatemalan birds sent by my dear Colombian friend who lives in Hartford, USA and the little figurine bought by my daughter in an exhibition in Newcastle in 2002, then the quirky carved Mexican man, now with only half a hat.\nIt feels good to put them back together, rough, no longer as they were but still better than broken, minus a head, minus a tail.  The giraffe now has his face, the bird its tail and wing and the fabulous French doll has her topknot head piece.\nToday the Press newspaper carried a story front page from a diary entry of Mrs Deans in the 1800’s.  She had just experienced a disturbing quake and was writing about it.  We are fascinated to read her account.  I am reminded of the importance of diary writing. \nJuly 3rd – and we have only had one small quake over the last 48 hours, the quietest period since September 4th 2010, 10 months and now this.\nChildren are playing peacefully with the farm animals and the blocks, having made an elaborate castle arrangement.  Their play vocabulary is still full of earthquakes. Quite nonchalantly one says “If there’s an aftershock, the castle tower, it will tip like this” and then they carry on with the fantasy game.  We went walking this afternoon, around the high path from Sandy Beach towards Maori Gardens.  As I walk with the two girls, aged 8 and 9, I realise it is my first walk around these steep paths since February.  What if there is a sharp jolt. It is sad and annoying to have these thoughts.\nLamb shanks, which have been marinating in red wine and thyme and garlic overnight, have been cooking in the oven for three hours.  Garlic parcels baking in thyme and olive oil give a comforting aroma through the house. It’s so cosy with the fire going and the oven going all afternoon.  The Sunday lemon cake as usual has been a success with family and visitors.\n3.30am 4th July and we have both been awake for an hour or more.  So weird to be awake because is it not shaking, but that’s how it is.  I feel incredibly anxious because it’s so calm.  I think Mark feels the same way, and many others today have nervously mentioned how quiet it has gone.  Mark said tonight, “It feels like the beast has stopped tormenting us” and I think “and now we’re feeling lost because the routine of torment has disappeared.”\nFor me I have been revisited by the terror of February 22nd tonight.  Sleeping here in the window seat area of the sitting room, the area where I ended up during the quake, brings back the memories.  I can’t believe four and a half months have gone by and that we are only just beginning to talk properly with each other about how the quakes have caused havoc with our relationship.  We talked about it tonight and Mark likened it to wartime when someone came back from the front and tried to connect with their old lives and found it so hard. There are so many stories of people, especially men, withdrawing and not sharing these war time experiences with the partners or the children.\nMark talked a bit tonight about how he felt when he exited the Provincial Chambers on that terrible day.  He said he feels guilty now that he didn’t notice the Durham Street church was down and that he didn’t even think about people being in it.  So many lives lost in seconds of terror, those organists all gathering in their lunch hour to work out how to save the organ in this church, already so damaged by the September quake,  their fatal error to be in there at that moment.  \nI find the city clocks fascinate me, frozen at their different times.  The east, the west and the south faces of the old railway clock stuck on 10.30 am from the Boxing Day shock which hit close by, and the north face stopped on 4.35 as a memorial to the Sept 4th 4.35 am quake.  The Mayor and Mayoress had proudly been present and had reactivated the clock to run again following the September quake.  It had ticked on until 26th December 10.30am where it has remained frozen in time.  And then to the Victoria Street Clock Tower – it stands still frozen in memory to 12.51 February 22nd, sadly broken and fragile buildings around it either demolished or in the process of. The Arts Centre clock, it too stuck on 12.51 and now it is stuck on nothing because on June 13th the face fell out. There is just a cavity now, a city frozen in time like a children’s fairy tale, but without the possibility of a fairy tale ending.  No prince can ride by and through his actions cause the city to wake again, the clocks to wind forward in time and start ticking again. \nA prince did drop by and speak words of comfort to a dazed crowd gathered in the park at the last of summer, but he could offer no magic.\nThis story is an extract from an unpublished manuscript written by Rosie Belton between 4 September 2010-22 February 2012.

        "text": "Repair number 3\nWe have our first project control meeting at 8am.   We find out that when Builder 2 built our foundation, he embedded a conduit for a fibre optic company that was not our provider, into the concrete.  Different companies use different conduits. That means the fibre for the company we are with can’t go through that conduit and will have to go in through a vent in the hebel wall.  \nSpring comes with a rush – warm days, and delicate blossoms, with splashes of vivid yellow daffodils.  Clouds of pine pollen from Bottle Lake Forest fall in great yellow drifts, fine as dust.  We head into town on a recommendation and go out for dinner with friends.  It is a gorgeous winter’s evening and great to see so many people back in town.  We have a great time.  \nOur project manager (at our request), e-mails a weekly update.  Things are going well.  We start to relax.  I think of the 46m long neon artwork on the wall of the Arts Centre. The large letters are each a different colour.  It practically shouts EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT.  One of the letters is no longer lit up.  It makes me smile.\nThe City Council publishes results of a regular wellbeing survey. 64% of homes have been or are in the process of repair, 30% are resolved, 22% are concerned about the quality of repair, 10% are taking action to resolve poor repairs and 6% are repairs of repairs. \nWe have a repair of a repair of a repair.  It has been 3 years since we moved out of home.  We have been renting all of that time and our possessions are still mostly packed in boxes in the garage.\nMy sister’s partner has had a bad year health wise.  After four operations to remove two massive kidney stones he has to have another one to remove an infection in the stump of the leg he had amputated following a vehicle accident in his teens.  My sister is again flying from Sydney (where she works) to Cairns (where he lives) to look after him.  It is very wearying and worrying.  \nI am clenching my teeth while I sleep, which is giving me earache.  Massage every fortnight is relieving this and helping me sleep.  The masseuse says I have to find peace as the focus on our repair for such a long time is no good for my health.   I need to relax, and just let things play out.  \nOur chimney has never been scoped as part of our insurance claim.   I request this is added, but this is rejected by our Loss Adjuster as he can’t find a photo of it on our file.  He has checked Google Earth 2014 and can not see a chimney.  He does not think to look at Google Earth prior to the earthquakes when we actually had a chimney.  It makes me laugh.\nI send him photos pf our chimney and a link to Google earth 2011 where our chimney is plan to see.   The Loss Adjuster is lovely, and accepts the amendment and asks the Quantity surveyor to price it.\nMy mother’s cousin Alan is in the Dominion Post on 10 September.  Robert Holland Taylor (my great grandfather), soldier 25/915 was 22 when he joined the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, on 12 October, 1915. When he sailed for Egypt four months later, on the steamship Ulimaroa, he listed Lucy Taylor –his wife of barely two years –as next of kin. His one-year-old son Charles is Allan’s dad.\nIn February 1919, after three bloody years on the Western Front, Bert – his sleeve bearing two wounded stripes  -came home.  Allan says “To a certain extent, I think my grandfather’s life ended when the war ended.  Despite his intelligence and ability, he was a man without any ambition. Whether the war had knocked it out of him, I don’t know. As long as he could get a game of bowls and had his pipe and could tell stories, he was just content. His brother was a company director and yet my grandfather –I think something disappeared. He wasn’t worried about the present. He lived in the past.  \nThere was scarcely a conversation when it didn’t come up. If it was raining, Bert would say “By jove it rained on the Somme for the three weeks we were there”. A swamp would transform into the sodden ground of Passchendaele, in which many a wounded man drowned. He’d recall napping in an abandoned trench, only to find in the morning that German scouts had the same idea. Or they were piling the dead as temporary trench protection, anticipating an advance, only to be holed up for weeks, steeped in the stench of decaying flesh.”\nBert went on to fight at Passchendaele in 1917, where shrapnel cut a hole in his left shoulder. He should have died but hitched a ride to a field hospital, attaching himself to the back of the truck, in case he lost consciousness. He came to 12 days later in a hospital in Walton-on-Thames, near London, in Britain.  There is a photo of him in the hospital bed.\nI think of my dad who died last year of lung cancer at the age of 77.  He was evacuated from Guernsey during the second world war.  Without that war I wouldn’t be alive.  I remember telling him that he Christchurch earthquakes and its aftermath have left the city looking like it had been bombed, like a war zone, but without the bullets.  My dad always refused to go back home following the war.  He was a refugee, but his home was here.\nWe are refugees in luxury – we are renting a nice house that our insurance company pays for.  We have to be patient and we have to wait.  There are so many people worse off than us.\nThe February 2011 earthquakes have taken lives, many lives, and more would have been lost if it were not for the September 2009 earthquakes, as so many dangerous buildings were red zoned.\nI think of the people who died in the Christchurch earthquake, and of their families, and hope that they do not live in the past, but can see the present, and look forward to the future.\nTerry’s sister calls. She has (luckily) had a mammogram which (unluckily) found breast cancer.  She is booked in for a 12-hour double mastectomy.  As her aunt has survived breast cancer, and her mum Diane died of uterine cancer, there is a genetic risk to Terry and his brother for prostate cancer. It seems a cruel irony that the genetic code that ignites life is the same one that can extinguish it.\nIt’s the school holidays.  I meet a friend that I haven’t seen for ages, and we walk through the Botanic Gardens into town.  You cannot beat Christchurch on a warm spring day.  The tulips lift their white, soft pink, chick yellow and blood red heads above bedding plants of purple or orange.  It’s like a fireworks display, but better.",

Brian, the boss was digging some potatoes and I was talking to him. All of a sudden the ground just seemed to rise up underneath us. I hit the ground and more sensibly Brian ran to see if the others were ok, which they were. \nGovernors Bay gardens is a very beautiful area, with lots of Bellbirds, Wood Pigeon, Fantails, Waxeyes and so on that add to the beauty of the site. We had lunch under the trees and kept an ear on the van radio. Reports of the size of the  tremor and so on were coming in rapidly. Also we heard of the demise of our beloved Cathedral. For me it didn’t really seem real until we got back to Christchurch and saw the traffic chaos that ensued and also the the damage that was evident to the rock walls coming down the Cashmere hills. Little did I know of the central city chaos and the building that had collapsed people trapped and more importantly people missing and killed.\nOn the drive back over the hill there was evidence of rock falls on the road, but nothing that stopped us us getting back. Getting back to Colombo street we were greeted with traffic chaos with the cars nose to tail and people on foot, outside of schools it was even busier.\nSue was the driver and very patient and she had decided to take Tyson out to Avonhead where he lived.  That took us about two and a half hours. There was lots of crawling and general traffic jams, but, at the same time when we were stalled the after shocks were coming thick and fast and the van was rocking around all over the place. Our next destination was back to the City Mission. We didn’t dare make a wrong turn because you’d never make it home. The Mission car park was locked so we were unable to get our cars. Sue took me to Linwood and I had to walk home from there. All the while the traffic chaos ensued. I even had to take off my shoes and socks to get through the water. I got home to Avondale about 7.30 and all the neighbours were shovelling liquifaction and fighting to keep it out of the house. It was a very late night no dinner no electricity, no water.\nLouise.",

I heard my youngest, then one month, wake up in her room and proceeded to get her a bottle ready when house started to shake, I thought” oh no what do I do.” Isobelle was screaming and standing on her chair, I ran to her, kicked the chair out from under her and crouched down to get under the table the table jumped in mid air side to side. I froze, Isobelle was still screaming. Holding her I honestly did not know what to do. I was so scared myself. Then the shaking stopped and I realised Katelyn! \nI put Isobelle down and opened the hallway door. The floor was covered in broken glass from family photos. I looked at Isobelle’s bare feet, picked her up, held her in a rugby hold and ran down the hallway trying my best to miss the glass. We reached Katelyn’s door and I placed Belle down on a clear part of carpet and told her very sternly to stay still and do not move. I tried to open Katelyn’s door, it wouldn’t open. I pushed and pushed, it opened a small way, the bassinet had moved against the door. I was able to reach in and lift up a very wide eyed shocked but quiet little baby. \nMy mum was probably one of the last people to get through on a cellphone asking if we were ok and that she was on her way. We were standing outside, both with sturdy footwear on when the first or second aftershock hit, I can’t remember. The aftershocks kind of merged together, the civil defence sirens rang and rang and rang and I knew our lives had just changed forever and I was scared but I couldn’t cry  I had to be strong for my babies. Then I heard the movement of gravel in our driveway someone was coming, someone was coming to help us. It was my daughter’s uncle, Tony. Never in my life have I been more happier and relieved to see another adult. \nBut the worse feeling was to come was my partner ok at work, how long would it take for him to get home, would we see him again. We decided to pack the car and head to my mums. We cellotaped a sign to our front door for Mike and we headed on to the road. We were sitting in gridlock when my dad text from the North Island ‘6.3 lyttelton Mike ok?’ My heart sank my partner fixes machinery at the Lyttelton port. He was right in the epicentre but again I couldn’t cry I had to be strong. I heard via text that he was walking home and was safe but it wasn’t until evening that Mike arrived on his bike with his backpack full of food, torches and things we needed that he came through the gate at my mums. I was so happy to have our family all in one place. \nIt was three days till my mum and her partner sourced a generator from a friend in Dunedin that we were able to turn on the TV and see the devastation that had happened to our beautiful city. I wasn’t ready mentally or practically to experience a disaster of this scale. \nWe now have an emergency and getaway kit which I hope to not have to use again but makes me feel a lot more secure with my young ones.

I pulled over and parked in a safe space, as I looked in my mirror I saw building collapse into Colombo Street. \nAs I parked my car, grabbed my phone and keys and ran back into the mayhem.\nI had been an Emergency Nurse for 15 years and had done specialist training in “Multiple Casualty Disaster Triage”, so even though I no longer work as a nurse, I went onto auto pilot.\nThe Tasty Tucker cafe had collapsed and there where people grappling at the rubble to free the people who were stuck there. I sent people into cars to get first aid kits, blankets, towels, anything that can be used to administer field first aid. \nThe first person I treated was “margaret” she was badly injured but we stemmed the bleeding and put a sling on her arm, I found a lady to sit with her while I went into the cafe to try and help people out. \nThe next person to come out of the cafe was carried out on a door and I administered CPR in the middle of Colombo Street assisted by strangers. The efforts were futile, and as I looked at a police officer and told him there was no hope, he looked at me and nodded. We covered her and went onto assisting those we could save from the collapsed Tasty Tucker Cafe.\nMany of us worked together to move the injured to the rear of the spotlight plaza and set up a makeshift field hospital and wait for transport to hospital. We had an abundance of blankets and warmth from Spotlight and other retailers, the pharmacy also provided valuable first aid equipment.\nAbout 40 minutes had passed since the 6.3 and I had still not made contact with my husband or 2 of my 3 Children, I felt alone, scared and helpless. I approached some police officers and told them my background and asked where I could be of use now we had the injured of Sydenham sorted. I had to stay busy through fear, as I was not sure how my family were. I could no longer access my car, so the Officers took me into the CBD with them.\nThe four of us were dispatched to walk the CBD looking for trapped or injured people. We walked along the strip, Lichfield Street, Manchester Street, Cashel Street. We stood on the corner of Cashel and Manchester and looked up in disbelief at the Hotel Grand Chancellor. We rushed down Cashel Street to what was left of the CTV building. What we saw on that walk that afternoon will live with me forever, it was devastating.\nI arrived in Latimer Square and advised of my skills I was immediately despatched to the PGC Building with another person, I rode his mountain bike through the battered streets. We arrived at PGC and began to set up a triage centre.\nAs the survivors came out one by one we assessed them, bandaged them, kept them warm and moved to the next person. It was a long, sad and eerie afternoon.\n\nAs a wife and mother I was still in the dark as to where my family were. I had been trying sporadically to text and call my husband and Children, to no avail. So I kept busy.\nMy cellphone rang in may back pocket, it was my Mother calling from Sydney. She could get through but I could not call my family here.\nFinally at about 4.30 I tried again to call my daughter answered the phone. Her first words were, “we are all with dad in the car”, I could not believe that in the mayhem and chaos they were safe and together and uninjured, I cried tears of joy and relief.\nI stayed at the PGC building quietly doing what I could until about 6.30pm when I decided it was time to be with my family, there were enough emergency services and medical crews there, so I farewelled the strangers I had worked with and began the long lonely walk home. I eventually put my thumb out and hitched a couple of rides to get closer to home and my family. It was about 8pm by the time we reunited. \nNo relief can ever measure up to that I felt when my family were all together again.",

When it struck I was showing a friend some photos on the computer. We both got thrown across the lounge. Things were falling everywhere.  My partner got thrown across the drive. After the Quake struck and one big aftershock we  heard about what was happening  not far away in town.

We’d been Civil defence welfare volunteers for years and in the Sept quakes had been part of the team at the Addington raceway. For years we’d heard about the alpine fault and at first thought in Sept the quake was coming from that. \nCrossing Milton street on Colombo a big aftershock struck then we saw crowds of people walking out of town and their faces I’ll never forget those faces and that aftershock. People were crying and shocked I was shocked and shaking. Sydenham Park was full of small liquefaction volcanoes A weird sight. \nAt a friends we had a cup of tea out in the yard on a gas ring All we could hear were sirens Everything was surreal then helicopters later  With no power or water we started on our stored supplies and amid aftershocks started our barbecue. Opened tins and sat around at our place with our neighbours It was the night from hell with aftershocks  every half hour.

        "text": "I am a 72 year old retired electronics Sales Engineer. I had just bought a house of my dreams in Governors Bay earlier that year and then was overseas for 4 months. I arrived back on the 1st September and was confronted with a number of slips in the Bay Area due to the heavy rain I understood had occurred that August. I can only remember talking to my neighbour the previous evening before the Sept Quake and asking. “Was my new home built into solid rock foundations”? The fact that he gave me an un-ensuring answer left me in a clear  frame of mind as to what was happening seven hours later.  \nThere was no doubt in my mind that my home was sliding down the cliff and I was about to meet my dear departed wife. I survived 4.35.\nIt’s 4.35am, not a time that that in the past I can recall ever been woken.\n\nBut suddenly awake with a startling fright. Nothing said, nothing spoken.\n\nMaybe I am dreaming this is all surreal.  It can’t be, I am secure I am free.\n\nNot able to think for noise, Jumbo Jet engine’s with a deafening shrill.\n\nWhat was going on? I can’t stand still. The ground comes up to meet as I crawl.\n\nThe noise is load I don’t hear the pictures, the mirrors and the glassware fall.\n\nWhat seems like eternity and the thoughts so many, maybe it was an hour?\n\nFeeling that life was been taken, slipping away but everything is still shaken.\n\nWith such commotion and movement and deliberation gave one an uncertain sensation.\n\nThat this was the end this is such a shame I just bought this house and I’m to blame.\n\nThe house I just bought with all its fantastic sea views now left a desire to be refused.\n\nAt last it all subsides you lay spread eagled on the bedroom floor holding on.\n\nThen silence, your breathing is heavy. How many times have you said “Oh my God?”\n\nDid you know what you were saying and now I am on my feet in total darkness.\n\nStanding up feeling each wall.  I can’t remember where the doors are I can’t recall.\n\nStill in blackness and you try to remember where you left the candles and torch.\n\nBody shaken more than the floor. Be logical and calm of course you’re in no harm.\n\nStruggling in a daze in bewildering pattern, is your house still on the cliff, did it happen?\n\nHere am I in that changed world, am I really alive. What ever happened did I survive.\n\nBut then with found torch and candles in hand I am again born in my house on my land.\n\nMy back garden and deck with tables and chairs. Their still part of me, they are still there.\n\nMy faith and belief in all that’s contentious bring me to understand that life is tremendous.\n\nIt just pores over me I burst into tears. What the hell happened? I have lived my worst fears.",

        "text": "Insurance claim\nI have a dream where I am in a large group and we are all given a small golden key, and a map of the door our key opens.  We excitedly head off in various directions.  I open the door and head into a long white corridor.  There are people walking up and down the corridor, but soon I am on my own.  \nSuddenly a white partition slides down from the ceiling to the floor behind me and the light brightens.  I run my hand along the left wall and walk 10m straight into an identical partition.  After a few frantic minutes my  hand fortunately touches a white panel on the wall.  The partition opens and I walk through.  \nWithin 5m the process is repeated.  Soon there is only 1m between me and the partition in front of and behind me and the light is blinding. \nWhen this door opens, I am in a large hall, where a red floor slopes gently upwards.  People are sliding down the floor towards me.  I make my way slowly up the hall, and the people disappear.  The floor is so polished it is difficult not to slide backwards.  I pass the skeletal remains of human bodies lying on the floor.  The end of the hall is in sight, and the floor levels off into panelled wood.  I now have a choice of doors.  There are people milling about with maps of the maze, discussing which way they should go, and which ways they have tried, only to end up back here.  \nI follow a couple who seem to have it sorted, and enter through one of the doors to discover that I am in a maze.  I place my hand on the left wall, and wherever it turns I go.  The light in the maze dims as I progress, and by the end I am in complete darkness.  It is hard to know exactly where the exit is and I have to resist the temptation to keep walking.  \n\nI stop, being careful to keep facing the same way and wait.  I run my hands systematically over the entire wall, from bottom to top.  After what seems like an eternity, but is probably only about 10 minutes, I find what I was expecting – a small key hole.  My golden key got me into this maze, and I am sure it will get me out of it.  I carefully slip my key into the key hole and the black partition slides noiselessly up.  I am out the other side.  There are no damaged streets, or orange cones, or partly demolished buildings, just people going about their daily lives.  \nA friend waves to me “Where have you been – haven’t seen you for ages!” \n\n“I’ve just been in a maze” I said, pointing to the exit door near the basement of a large department store. \n\n“Sounds like fun” he laughs, obviously thinking that I have got caught up in the shopping sales.  \n\n“It’s good to be out of it” I said.",

        "text": "A Week in Christchurch – Wednesday 23 Feb to Sat 5 March 2011\n\nA personal account by Peter J Seager\nIntroduction\n12.51 Tuesday 22 Feb 2011 – A point in time that will go down in history as a defining moment for New Zealand and its people. \nAt this moment, the magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Christchurch. A city that had been recovering from the damage of the larger but more distant quake of September 2010 was shattered beyond comprehension and changed forever. \nThe level of devastation was so great that even weeks later, people had difficulty grasping the scale of destruction or the enormity of the task that lies ahead for Christchurch, its citizens and New Zealand as a whole.\nThose present on the day struggle to find the words to describe what they went through and what has happened to their city. Those that came to their aid were met by scenes that defied conventional description. That normal words seemed hopelessly inadequate to describe. \nAs the tales of tragedy and heroism began to emerge, and New Zealand began to grasp the enormity of the catastrophe that was underway, the greatest rescue operation that New Zealand has ever seen, one that would come to involve hundreds of rescuers from many different countries, began to swing into action.\nPart of this operation, was the first ever mass mobilisation of the 18 volunteer light Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) Response Teams. I am a member of one of these teams – NZRT16 of Tauranga, Bay of Plenty. This is my attempt to tell my story of what I witnessed and experienced over the following ten days.\nTuesday 22 Feb – The first day.\n“Do you have your pager thingy with you?” These were the words (or something like them) that I was greeted with by a colleague at work. The time was shortly after 1pm. I was in my office reviewing job applicants.\n“Why is that?” I asked. ‘J’ replied that she had just heard from a typist that there had been another big quake in Christchurch and as I had a CD pager, perhaps I knew something. ‘J’ father lives in Christchurch.\nI did not – The pager was at home! A quick look at the Herald website revealed that a large quake had occurred. As more information was gleaned from other websites, it soon became apparent that an event of great seriousness had taken place. There was loss of life, but the scale was unknown at this time. \nOver the next couple of hours, more news came in. Modern buildings had collapsed this time. People were trapped. The first pictures and videos of frantic rescue attempts from the Pyne Gould Corporation building were seen. It was apparent that the situation was very serious, although the enormity of what was happening was yet to sink in.\nMid afternoon, whilst still at work, I received a phone call asking if I was available, and if so, could I prepare my PPE that evening with a view to deployment possibly the following day. The plan was that we would be self sufficient for three days and that we should prepare to be away for seven.\nI went to see my boss. I requested that I had been asked my availability and was that ok with her. She checked with the next up the ladder, who quickly agreed to release me.\nI spent the rest of the day trying to tidy up some loose ends in anticipation! That evening, I checked and repacked my personal equipment and packed some clothes etc. At the time, I had one eye on the continuous news coverage, which only seemed to get worse by the hour.\nIn the evening, an email was received from Shaun the Team Manager, advising that there was a very strong likelihood of deployment and that we were officially on standby. At this time, it was expected that we would fly down!!\nSleep that night could best be described as ‘fitful’\nWednesday 23 Feb – The Road South.\nWednesday began with a radio news announcement that the Bay of Plenty teams had been deployed! As I was still at home and about to go to work, I contacted Pete the Team Leader, who confirmed that we were still on standby and that a final decision was not expected before midday.\nI told My daughter that it was likely that I would be going to Christchurch that day, but not yet certain.\nI went to work, taking my kit bag and personal bags with me. Of course, I soon realised I had forgotten some stuff, but thought I would have time to go home and collect what was missing. My manager even asked if I wanted to go home to rest, but as I thought that nothing was going to happen until at least lunchtime, I decided to stay and try and sort out outstanding tasks.\nAround 10.30, I received a phone call to assemble at Barkes corner ASAP! The plan now was to drive to Wellington for an 8pm ferry.\nSuddenly from believing I had several hours in hand (if indeed anything was going to happen this day), I was thrown into a frantic last minute dash to tell people I was going, to call ‘S’ my wife, to ask ‘R’ (Senior MRT and unofficial 2ic) to sort out the interviews for me and to catch my manager on the way out and tell her I was off. \nI drove to Barkes corner (Council office and local EOC), to find the team assembling. Over the course of the next hour, everyone arrived. Initial tasks were handed out – i.e. food shopping, vehicle hire etc. ‘S’ met me there, bringing some spare clothes, but in the rush, I managed to forget to ask for both sunhat and sunglasses. \nFollowing a series of slightly awkward family farewells, we were briefed by the local emergency manager as to some general operating principles. Then we were off.\nThree vehicles, two trailers and 10 personnel. Shaun, Peter, Melvern, Bernie, Audrey, Craig, Kevin, Gene, David and me.\nTime was tight, but with the number of drivers, we made it to Wellington shortly after 7pm. Stops were limited to fuel and driver changeovers, with one food stop in Bulls. \nWe lined up and boarded a special sailing of the Interislander.\nOn the car deck was a fire engine from Hutt Valley, several ‘City Care’ trucks and a truck and trailer from the Hobbit set at Matamata that was carrying diesel and water supplies south.\nThanks to a friendly Purser, several bunkrooms were made available at no charge. The crossing was flat calm and I managed to sleep most of the way across. We arrived in Picton around 11.30pm and took the road south (after collecting 40 litres of Diesel from the ‘Hobbit man’)\nThursday 24 Feb – Arrival in Christchurch and First impressions.\nThe long drive to Christchurch seemed interminable. Sleep was hard to come by, but we kept going, changing drivers as required. The outskirts of the city and the first cordon were reached just before 5am.\nThe ‘road closed’ sign and attendant police were not what brought home that we were entering a situation quite out of the ordinary. That was achieved by the armoured personnel carrier sitting adjacent to the roadblock as if daring anyone to try and break through. \nAPC’s and other army vehicles would come to be very common sights over the next week, as would the combination of Kiwi and Singaporean soldiers assisting the NZ (and later Australian) police in the manning of the cordons.\nOur small convoy found its way to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) located in the new art gallery. The time was 5am and upon entering, we were greeted by an official who looked like he had been on duty continuously since the day of the quake. He did not seem to know what to do with us, nor did his colleague. Unsurprisingly, there were few people in the building at this time. ‘Breakfast’ in the form of last nights pizza leftovers was however available.\nAs we waited for information, another Civil Defence official let us know that the operations were being controlled out of Latimer Square. Despite being only a half dozen blocks away, this could only be reached by going outside the cordon and right around the CBD. \nLatimer Square had been an early triage point. Its close proximity to the CTV building as a large and safe open space virtually guaranteed that this location would serve a key role throughout the crisis. As the following days progressed, this area became base of operations for both the Task Forces and Response Teams and base camp for the task forces, both NZ and international. The art gallery remained the overall EOC as well as being a further operations base for some RT taskings.\nEventually, we were directed to Latimer Square for further information. From there, we were directed to a scout camp on the outskirts (Rimu camp in Yaldhurst). By now, day was breaking and we had our first proper glimpses of collapsed buildings and wrecked streets as we drove through the city.\nReaching the campsite a little after seven am, we found a number of other response teams in residence, including Hutt Valley, Palmerston North, Whakatane and others. Team vehicles and trailers were all loaded up and ready to go. More than I had ever seen in one place outside an exercise. \nThe plan was that after setting up camp and a few hours sleep, we would report to Latimer square for tasking. \nThe meal we prepared on waking ended up being the only meal we prepared ourselves the whole deployment. (More on the catering arrangements later).\nGear was checked and the team left for Latimer Square. Now in bright sunlight, the destruction was more obvious and quite surreal. We drove past sights that would come to be familiar over the coming days; The car perched on top of the pile of rubble on Tuam street outside a devastated parade of upmarket shops, and approaching Latimer Square, the row of cars with the collapsed building on top. These stayed untouched the whole time we were there. \nParking up, we found the Operations base (BOO), signed in and settled down to wait for our first tasking. This proved to be a long wait, but unfortunately, not the only one we had all week! In the time we had, we were able to ‘explore’ the Square. One whole half was taken up by the task forces. This included the NZ, Australian, Japanese, Taiwanese and later the Chinese contingents. The half that the response teams were based in also housed the Singaporean team, and was to house the Americans and UK teams when they arrived the following day. One result of this was that the area allocated to the RT’s shrunk daily! \nOn the plus side however, we were closest to the catering.\nA few of us wondered to the end of the fenced off area. Beyond the fence was a row of TV cameras and media crews. A short distance away, several diggers could be seen at work on a large collapsed building. It suddenly dawned on me where we were. This was our first sight of the CTV building and the sight of the recovery works going on less than a block from where we were standing was one that would recur throughout the deployment.\nAfter nearly two hours of waiting, we received the first task – To carry out welfare and property checks in the suburb of Woolston. Upon parking up in a garage forecourt, we were almost immediately approached by a local concerned about the welfare of his father in an adjacent house. Kevin checked this out, to find that the man was ok, but the main concern was that the medic alert alarm system wasn’t functioning. The main phones were however. \nWe were split into pairs and issued streets. The checks began. At the first house that me and Bernie visited, we found a large family in residence and were greeted by a child calling to her parent – “The earthquake people are here”. The property had been damaged in the September quake and had been damaged further this time round. The family were living in the garage at night! \nDamage all round was variable, although most houses seemed liveable in. We carried out our checks and filled out our forms. The reception from the residents was good, although in return, many seemed nervous and ‘wired’. We were the first official presence they had seen and they were keen to talk. Power and water were both on, but sewage was out. Some properties had suffered badly from liquefaction. One resident had already cleared his driveway with a bobcat, leaving a channel through the silt some 6 to 8 inches deep.\nWe had been going for only about an hour, when we were recalled to Latimer square. The task had not been completed!\nNo more taskings this day. Instead, we spent the rest of the day being offered food and drink by the eager and helpful caterers, unloading a truck of water and Powerade for the RT’s and watching a live broadcast being made by TV1 news looking towards the CTV building.\nEventually, we were debriefed and returned to the scout camp. \nFriday 25 February – The Eastern Suburbs\nFriday started early with the noise of a very large plane seemingly landing right on top of us. ‘Here’s the Americans’ I thought. This turned out to be right. We arrived at Latimer square a little after 7am, to find the American team setting up camp. They had arrived on a chartered United Airlines 747. This had proved not big enough to house all of their gear and they had had to leave two thirds behind!!\nThis is probably as good a time as any to mention the drive in, in the morning. From the camp in Yaldhurst to Hagley Park, life continues. Traffic flows normally. Pedestrians are walking. Life seems pretty much normal. Damage in Riccarton is relatively light and tends to be isolated to individual buildings, which are fenced off. \nPast Hagley Park however, the first cordon is reached and everything changes. Within the cordon, you enter a surreal world of shattered buildings and blocked roads. Life is totally different. Every person, every piece of equipment, every effort is concentrated on rescue or recovery. The atmosphere is intense, focussed and more than a little weird. I had to constantly remind myself that this was actually real.\nRoads entering the city were variable. Coming past Hagley Park, the first damaged roads are encountered. For much of the deployment, most roads within the CBD and many outside were in a very poor state with holes, humps, pools of silt etc. Later on, some evidence of repair could be seen and the piles of silt were gradually removed.\nBack to Latimer Square – Our first deployment of the day was back to Woolston, the area of the day before. This time, we were issued with the correct forms and were asked to mark the pavements outside each property with its status (clear or not clear). This lasted even less time than Wednesday and we were again called back to Latimer square after covering only a few houses!!\nSome time later, we were asked to support an engineer in an outer suburb (not sure where). On finding him, he did not need USAR assistance. Back to Latimer square again! This drive was memorable for the long line of manhole covers sitting proud of the road. The road had sunk around the sewage pipes, leaving the manholes sitting high!\nLunch at Latimer Square – Then another task. This time to the eastern suburb of Mount Pleasant. Over the Ferrymead bridge and on the road to Sumner, these areas had yet to be visited by rescue teams. The bridge itself was in the process of being repaired following the September quake, when this one hit. It was again severely damaged and had only just reopened with a weight limit of 3.5 tonnes. Calculations were made and it was decided that the vehicles would just make it.\nOn the way, we drove past a ‘BBQ Warehouse’ where the front slabs had collapsed. \nThe bridge itself was very bumpy and the temporary structures built on either side to support the bridge could clearly be seen to be leaning out of true. Past the bridge, the roads deteriorated further, with cracks and slippage and the appearance that the whole lot was sliding into the adjacent harbour. There was much traffic, mostly heading the other way. I made a comment that they all seemed to be heading out of town. I think I was right in many cases!\nWe parked up at the base of our sector adjacent to a house where a sidewall had blown out. A wooden bedstead could be clearly seen in the gap.\nI was paired up with Bernie and tasked to start at the base of Maffeys Rd and proceed up one side. Audrey and Craig were to start on the other side. Melvern and Kevin checked the street lower down, whilst the remainder of the team drove up Maffeys Rd to start at the streets higher up.\nUnsure where Maffeys Rd began, we picked a house and started there. This turned out to be inhabited by a severely shocked resident, who was having difficulty coping. His main property damage came from water pipes, but there were large cracks under the house. We did what we could for him (which wasn’t much), left him with the phone numbers and moved on. Liquefaction here had been strong. His car was buried up to its axles!\nFor each property, we were required to fill out a ‘level one’ building inspection report and if residents were present, a welfare report. I wondered what happened with these reports, and whether the people, like this gentleman who clearly were in need of urgent assistance, were going to get the help they needed at an early stage. This one house took two of us over twenty minutes. An idea of how big the task was. We were indeed the first people he had seen, and like in Woolston the day before, people wanted to talk. It was neither practical nor fair to cut them off early. Stress was clearly very high all round, with many people on edge.\nIt turned out that this house was not Maffeys road at all, which started a few houses up. We walked on, checking and marking as we went! (Each house was marked on the pavement outside with ‘RT16’, the date and C or NC. We were not tasked with entering closed properties (That would come to a later team), but could enter a house if the resident was present. Proceeding up Maffeys road, the road surface was severely damaged and had collapsed at one side. It was only passable at all because a load of gravel has been tipped into the giant crack running across the road. \nWe noticed a steady trickle of cars coming down Maffeys road. Many of these were loaded up with belongings. Stopping each in turn, we confirmed our belief that these were residents leaving town. We tried to get names and addresses from as many as we could!\nThe inspections up Maffeys road continued. This road is very steep and was badly cracked. Very few residents were home. One empty house had been abandoned so quickly, the key was still in the lock and a bag was just inside the door. We decided to enter to check the house was empty. This turned out to be the case, although interior damage was severe. \n\nThe degree of property damage was very high with severe levels of damage to nearly every house. Very few properties appeared habitable. Some houses had lost the entire exterior block cladding, with the building paper visible all round. Another had had nearly every tile on the roof misplaced. Houses were leaning to greater or lesser degrees. Windows were broken, or had fallen out completely. At one house though, we did encounter an insurance assessor who was checking on temporary repairs to secure a property. Other houses showed signs of attempts at clean up with boxes of glass swept up and windows boarded. In some houses, the tobies (water taps) had been isolated.\nWe were to later find out that this area had suffered ground accelerations in excess of 1G. The houses quite literally had taken off before coming back down again! This area was only a few Km’s from the epicentre.\nFrom the elevated position of Maffeys road, we could see some rugby fields near the water. Large patches of grey silt from liquefaction could be seen.\nTwo army Iroqouis helicopters flew overhead, the distinctive ‘wop wop’ fading away as the helicopters disappeared around a further hill.\nOne houses driveway had collapsed, leaving a light truck tipped over the edge.\nThe searches continued for a couple of hours up Maffeys road and down La Costa lane until the team was once again recalled before the task had been completed.\nWe returned to Latimer Square, where after dinner, we were debriefed. There were no further tasks this day.\nThe UK team, the last of the international task forces arrived this day too, taking up the last spots in Latimer Square.\nSaturday 26 February – Engineer support\nSaturday started with the now familiar routine of forcing myself out of the sleeping bag and into wakefulness! Getting ready and heading into Latimer Square for breakfast and team Leaders briefing at 07.30.\nDespite the early start, we were not issued with a team task. Instead, the morning was spent with ‘hurry up and wait’. Characterised by frequent visits to the mess area and chatting with members of international teams to pass the time. The catering area was getting more organised each day. The volunteers from the Brethren were always available to hand out food and drink to the rescuers. Much of this was donated. Today, a wooden archway was built to control entry and provide a hand sanitising area. (There was no hot water anywhere in the Square. Instead, hand sanitizer was used frequently!)\nDuring the morning John Key visited the Square. We had heard he was coming and assumed he would spend his time with the Taskforces and International teams. On hearing that he was on his way through, a few of us went to see him walk by, on his way (as we thought) to the Americans. However, on the way by, he was introduced to the Responders lined up and stopped to say a few words to every one. \nJust after lunch, volunteers were requested to assist with engineer support tasked out of the EOC (art gallery). Gene, Melvern and myself volunteered and were driven to the EOC by a very circuitous route. In a direct line, it is only half a dozen blocks, but about a fifteen-minute drive by vehicle. \nAfter a short wait at the EOC, the three of us, along with other responders were given our taskings. These were, one responder to support two engineers carrying out level one inspections of a city block. I was issued with a map and phone number for ‘my’ engineer. I contacted him to find his location and along with the others, was given a lift to the area. Another long round trip to a block in the lower half of the CBD between Madras and Manchester Streets. Gene was on the other side of Manchester Street, Melvern was further north.\nThe task was to provide safety support, i.e. another overview of what was around, whilst the engineers inspected properties and prepared paperwork. This allowed me time to look around. After being dropped off initially, I could see the expanse of destroyed building stretching up Manchester Street. The three of us proceeded along Southwark Street to Madras Street. Along the way, we passed a car park with a car badly damaged by an adjacent brick wall. \nHalf way through, we were on Madras Street. With my still poor local geography, it took me a while to work out what building was being worked on a few blocks away by several diggers and cranes. It was the CTV building, with Latimer Square visible just beyond.\nDamage in this block was mixed. Some buildings appeared undamaged and were stickered green. Others had leaning walls or cracked brickwork and were stickered yellow or red accordingly. One café still had cakes in the display cabinet and the tables and chairs had been stacked up neatly!\nIn another area, a concrete slab had collapsed on top of vacant parking areas.\nTowards the end of the block, we passed an old hotel / pub, which had been damaged in September and again this time. Exposed lath and plasterwork could be seen. This building was ticketed ‘red’. The end of the block took us back to Manchester Street. I realised how quiet it was.\nTo the south, the visible damage was lighter. But as I turned north, a scene of great devastation was revealed.\nShop front after shop front had collapsed. Mounds of rubble and bricks were strewn everywhere. Enough of a path has been cleared to allow passage along the road. The scene stretched for as far as the eye can see. Hanging in the distance over all, was the Hotel Grand Chancellor. From this angle, a slight but distinct lean could be seen.\nNo crowds were walking, no cars driving. The silence was total and a little unnerving. I could be the only person for miles. Not quite though. The two engineers that I was escorting were completing the paperwork for an adjacent property. Another green, yellow or red sticker was issued.\nLooking north, another team could be seen in the distance on the same task as us. We continued with our block.\nUpon completing the block, we decided to walk back to the EOC, there being a fairly direct route that skirted Cathedral Square and the central blocks of the CBD. The first part of this route was up Manchester Street past the rows of collapsed shop fronts seen earlier. The whole frontage had collapsed, leaving rooms eerily visible on the upper layers. In places, scaffolding had collapsed adding to the mountains of rubble. Turning left onto Tuam Street, we passed the end of Columbo Street, where the two buses crushed during the quake were still present. The street end was closed off. Shop damage here was very heavy, with nearly every building partially or totally collapsed. I am not sure how many people died in the buses or the lower portion of Manchester Street, but the number was significant.\nWe eventually arrived back at the EOC and reported in. My two engineers were not retasked this day, so I waited for Melvern to arrive from his block. His return path had taken him near the Pyne Gould Corporation building!\nWe managed to hitch a ride back to Latimer Square, where we eventually rejoined RT16. They had commenced searching a light industrial CBD block. (Tuam to St Asaph Street and Barbadoes street to Fitzgerald Avenue). This search continued until nightfall. We returned to Latimer Square for dinner and debrief and then back to the scout camp.\nSunday 27 February – Property Searching\nFollowing Breakfast and briefing at Latimer Square, the block of the previous day was continued. The team was to spend the whole of the next three days on property searches within the CBD. The purpose of this was to clear each block in turn, thus allowing the cordon to be brought in past those blocks that had been relatively lightly damaged and within which, businesses could be allowed to start the cleanup and get back on with their trade.\nRT16 soon developed a routine, whereby one or two team members went on ahead to try and get phone numbers of property owners or alarm companies, in an attempt to get a keyholder to open up a business without entry being forced. This tactic was quite successful and enabled the team to proceed fairly rapidly on the task. We were escorted at all times by a policeman. These were usually Australians and were able to authorise forced entry if required.\nOnce entry was gained, several team members would quickly search the whole building, including side rooms, store rooms etc. Buildings with obvious serious damage, or those with red tickets were not entered.\nSunday morning’s block was towards the southeast corner of the cordon, between Tuam and St Asaph streets (North / South) and Barbadoes street and Fitzgerald avenue (East / West). Damage was varied, as was silt damage from Liquefaction. Amongst the buildings searched, was a bottle store. This shop was opened by the owner. The team was greeted by the aroma of 5 day old spilt wine and spirits. The mess was considerable with broken bottles and glass littering the floor, stained red by the sticky mess.\nNearby, was a paint store. Although seemingly ok from the front, (again opened by owner), this store suffered some of the worst silt damage seen. This was in some areas so deep, that 10 ltr paint buckets were nearly buried, with only the rims, or wire handles protruding from the muck. This store was also one example where the owner was concerned to retrieve the cash from the till, so he could pay his staff.\nAs the team searched through the racks of fallen paint cans, we could see a gaping hole at the rear. This turned out to be an entire concrete slab that had fallen from the rear of the store onto a car beyond. \nLater in the block search, the team had worked round to the rear of the store, where the crushed car could be more closely inspected. Also in the area, an adjoining car park wall had collapsed, crushing several cars under brickwork. This allowed easy entry to the rear of the paint store where the car could be checked. Silt here had covered the car up to the axles. The cars in this area were already marked clear.\nSeveral warehouses were searched, where racks of shelves had collapsed or shifted and aisles were filled with boxes of stock. All needed searching.\nA deli / foodstore contained an abandoned trolley with customers goods still stacked. Again stock was littering the aisles and bottles had broken all over. At the owner’s request, RT16 retrieved the cash registers.\nDuring the day, the Red Cross team was working the block opposite. \nUpon completing this block, we returned to Latimer Square for lunch and retasking. The afternoon saw us commence a large block at the southern end of the CBD between Wilmer Street and Moorehouse Avenue.\nThe Moorehouse avenue frontage was mainly car yards with the remainder being light industrial and some offices. This block was a joint tasking with the Red Cross team.\nAs Moorehouse Avenue was the edge of the cordon, we found ourselves in the unusual position of having heavy traffic moving past. A change from the desolation of other searches.\nWe were recalled to Latimer Square at 6pm. A relatively ‘early’ finish to the day.\nMonday 28 February – Rest Day\nToday, RT16 continued with block searching. I however, took a rest day. With several days still to go, I felt the need for a days rest. All other teams were deployed, leaving me alone at the scout camp, until the security guard turned up. The day was spent with a combination of camp chores, laundry, eating ancient freeze dried meals, and exploring the vast collection of home baking left for the response teams in the camp kitchen. \nIn the afternoon, whilst lying in the tent, a fair sized aftershock struck. Whilst I felt it as a good sized knock, the rest of the team were at that time on the 10th floor of an apartment block!! The team returned later in the evening.\nTuesday 1 March – 1 week on – Block search and 2 minutes silence.\nRT16 was tasked to search a large block of mainly mixed residential houses and apartments. Located at the upper end of the CBD above Latimer Square, the block stretched from Bealey Avenue to Melrose Street, and Barbadoes Street to Madras Street (East / West). A residential street (Otley Street) ran through the middle of the block, increasing the number of properties needing searching.\nWe began work at the garage on the corner of Bealey Avenue and Barbadoes Street. The garage was closed as the fuel tanks were possibly damaged. The ground around the tanks had sunk. Like other stores, there was much stock damage inside. Todays police escort was an AFP Sergeant from Perth, Pete or ‘PK’.\nThis block contained many older residential properties that had suffered considerably with collapsed walls and chimney stacks. Other properties were virtually untouched.\nAlthough within the cordon, many properties were still being lived in, which greatly assisted with the searching. Some residents were very distressed and clearly in need of assistance, which we were unfortunately unable to supply. We could do little other than complete welfare forms and hand out contact cards! \nMixed in with the houses were some small apartment blocks. Entry was a mixture of keyholder and forced entry.\nLunch was timed around the planned 2 minutes silence at 12:51. We returned to Latimer Square, expecting the silence to be called within the camp itself. However, as the time approached, we were all instructed to walk down to the CTV site one block away. This included all search teams present, and support staff, including the caterers. \nWe walked down the road, to see the site slowly revealed. At this time, the bulk of the debris had been removed. However, the charred lift shaft remained, along with a quantity of slabs and other rubble. The site was quite shocking to those like us, who had not seen it up close before. The atmosphere was sombre and subdued. As more personnel arrived, we spread around two sides of the block. \nA chaplain spoke, then the two minute silence followed, broken only by a solitary police radio. After more words, the teams were dismissed to return to Latimer Square. Already subdued by the experience, it was about to take another turn! As I walked along, I began to hear bagpipes playing Amazing Grace. As the corner of the site came closer, we could hear clapping. Where was this coming from? A group of family had been allowed in for the service and were standing on the corner applauding the rescuers as they walked by. One elderly man was holding up a photograph, possibly of his daughter. There were no words that could be exchanged and most of us carried on trying to hold in emotions until we were back at the Square! I saw one tough looking Australian fireman with tears in his eyes. There were many more.\nLater, we returned to complete the block of the morning. At one point, we met up with the SPCA Animal Rescue Unit, who were trying to retrieve an abandoned dog from a house.\nOne house searched had lost the whole sidewall, leaving rooms exposed but bizarrely undamaged, like some giant dolls house.\nLatimer Square was now at its peak of effectiveness. It had become a self-contained village housing several hundreds. Facilities included a fuel dump and medical facilities. There was even a camp masseuse and camp counsellor.\nThe masseuse (A professional sports masseuse and her partner) had shown up early in the deployment to offer support. They were eventually given their own tent and as word got round, queues of responders and Task Force members built up.\nAnnah (the counsellor) deserves a section on her own. From the first day, she had been working to assist those in need. As the Base of Operations became established at Latimer Square, she became the counsellor to the response teams. Throughout the deployment, she was available to chat to and to discuss the day’s events with. \nAlso on this day, a giant Marquee was erected to cover the catering area. The floor was covered and tables set up. Over the next two days, the catering was handed over to a professional catering company. The Brethren had completed their role of turning out thousands of meals every day in an ad hoc but highly organised operation.\nWednesday 2 March – EOC Taskings\nFollowing the now familiar early rise, drive to Latimer Square for breakfast, and wait for tasking, RT16 was tasked to support operations out of the EOC (art gallery). We understood that we would be assisting engineers in carrying out level 2 inspections. Due to the inherent hazard of level 2 searches, Responders would be allocated in pairs.\nRT16 then made its way the (as the crow flies) short journey to the art gallery. At this time, this journey took around 10-15 minutes.\nAlong with other RT’s tasked to the EOC (Victoria Uni and Gisborne were two that were present this day), we started the day with more ‘hurry up and wait’. The HQ tent of Saturday had been given over to Media, with RT taskings now coming from a much smaller tent next door. Further along, a green army marquee was the RT’s shelter.\nAs tasks were issued, the task sheets were brought from the control tent and given to the controller of the day – Roger from the Victoria Uni team. He would then ask for volunteers for whatever the task happened to be.\nMy first task along with five other RT16 members was to accompany staff from the Environment Canterbury Headquarters to remove essential documents and equipment. The ECAN HQ is next door to the Copthorne Hotel. This building was considered so potentially unstable, that the team was restricted to a 30 min recon and 30 min removal operation.\nWith transport limited to Christchurch City Council vehicles, RT16 rode to the operation in the back of a Ute, a task that would normally result in arrest!\nThe ECAN HQ consisted of several buildings – the main office block, and adjacent single story ‘bunker’ which also housed the server room and CDEM base. There was also a third block adjacent to the Copthorne, which was not entered. This building was considered too dangerous to enter.\nThe main block was checked first by engineers with RT support. Several windows needed to be knocked out to prevent them falling onto people below.\nAs the safety officer, I was giving 5-minute countdowns over the radio.\nThe plan for the equipment salvage, was that one team would enter each building. Each team consisted of several ECAN staff with two RT16 members in support. In the main building, the top floor was accessed first, then the team worked on down, removing items from each level as they passed. No access was allowed to a higher level once staff had left it.\nIn the bunker, the target was the server room in the far corner of the building.\nAs equipment was removed, this was placed outside. The ECAN staff were then allowed to re-enter the ground floors of each building. Occasionally, staff re-entered the opposite building, making an accurate personnel count difficult. However, at the end of the thirty minutes, all staff were counted out.\nAs safety, my instructions were to sound the whistle over the radio if evacuation was required. I picked a spot from where I could see both doors that the Responders and ECAN staff were using as well as the whole of the Copthorne Hotel. I could also maintain a clear escape route to the rear. \nFollowing completion of the task, we returned to the EOC.\nMy only other tasking this day was a two-man mission (with David), escorting two solicitors to clear documents from their offices. This task was to the top left corner of the CBD, and brought new vistas of shattered buildings into view!\nThe rest of the team carried out a variety of tasks this day, including a mission to refuel a cell phone tower generator, which gave Gene the opportunity to view the city from the top of the Radio Network tower.\nThe EOC was crawling with media as usual from many nationalities. TV1 and 3 were both making live broadcasts and orange overalls found their way into backgrounds on more than one occasion.\nDuring the middle part of the day, strong winds damaged the media tent, bending a scaffolding pole in a significant bow and causing the RT tent to attempt flight. Being good journalists, the media filmed or took photos of us saving their tent! At one point, both tents were being restrained by the manpower of several response teams. Large concrete blocks, with a person sitting or standing on them were lifted into the air by the strength of the wind. \nEventually, orders were given to take the RT tent down to prevent it from being blown away completely!\nIn the evening, we returned to Latimer Square for dinner and debrief.\nThursday 3 March !\nEarly on Thursday morning, Bruce, Audrey and Craig flew home.\nFor the rest of RT16, Thursday started out with high expectations. This was our last operational day of the deployment and we hoped to have a useful task. The briefing indicated that the RT’s would be tasked to rubble clearance in collaboration with the police and demolition contractors.\nWe then heard that the operation was on hold, pending a ‘legislation change’ at lunchtime. After second breakfast! The morning was spent buying equipment at Mitre 10.\nAfter lunch – No update and no tasking! The afternoon was spent hanging around Latimer Square with increasing frustration and occasional visits to the mess tent. Around 4.30, we were called back to BoO, where we were informed that the taskings were ready!\nThe unfortunate IC who had the forgettable task of giving this news offered the suggestion that the teams wait until the following morning. This was accepted.\nAs well as all the RT’s, three international task forces were also prevented from operating this day. It was estimated that some 1600 man-hours were lost. An incredible waste of manpower considering how much work was to be done. \nRT16 were commencing the journey home the next morning, whilst RT15 and 17 were only available for half a day.\nFor the evening, we went to the Yaldhurst Tavern ‘Yaldi’ with the Whakatane and Rotorua teams. Transport was arranged by the pub and food laid on. A good wind down evening before the journey back.\nFriday 4 March – The journey Home – Part 1\nRT16 broke camp and made the long drive to Picton, stopping in Kaikoura on the way. Making the trip in daylight this time and clear weather, the scenery through the Marlborough wine country was spectacular.\nAll teams were staying at the same motel. Dinner in the evening was at Picton RSA.\nSaturday 5 March – The Journey Home – Part 2\nThe three Bay of Plenty teams caught the 10am ferry back to Wellington. Despite a gale warning, the crossing was reasonably calm.\nThen came the long and interminable drive up the North Island. Stopping again in Bulls, we reached Tauranga at around 9.30 that evening.\nHome at last!\nReflections!\nIt takes some considerable time for the thoughts and experiences to settle down in a coherent fashion. Later on, you find yourself looking at events with a different point of view than the one you upheld either at the time, or shortly afterwards.\nFor just over a week, I was witness to and a small part of something quite incredible. To quote Dickens – “it was the best of times, it was the worst of times”. I saw the human spirit at its very best whilst at the same time the visions of shattered lives and a shattered city were sometimes difficult to behold.\nThe massive level of support for Christchurch was certainly unprecedented in my experience. \nThe size of the international search and rescue effort with official representation from Seven countries; Australia, America, UK, Singapore, Taiwan, China and Japan (and unofficial from two others (Mexico and Israel)) was quite humbling. \nThe deployment of nearly every registered and unregistered response team was another first. Although this part of the operation took several days to truly reach peak efficiency, the RT’s showed what could be achieved and how important they are to NZ.\nThe support that we as a team received was genuine and heartfelt. From the mumbled words of encouragement of a man on the ferry that first Wednesday night, to the New World manager who refused to let us pay for two cartons of beer, we were supported the whole way through.\nAm I glad I went? Yes. At the time we left, some had a feeling that we could have done more and were perhaps underused. In hindsight, I believe that we performed about as well as we could under the circumstances. A degree of chaos and confusion is only to be expected in the early stages of a disaster on this scale. It was suggested that we went down too early, that the operation was reaching peak efficiency just as the response teams were leaving. These points may be true. What is also true is that we as a team were not in a position to dictate grand strategy. RT16 completed its first ever full deployment, for an extended period, in a moderately stressful atmosphere as a strong and cohesive team, with no major operational breakdowns. For that, we should be satisfied.\nWould I do it again? – In a heartbeat.\nAt the time of writing this, some five months on, the demolition process in the CBD is grinding painfully on and the people of Christchurch still have a very long road to travel before the new city rises from the rubble of the old.\nPeter Seager (RT16)",
